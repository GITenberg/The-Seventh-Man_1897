    <h2>
      Chapter I. Spring
    </h2>
    <p>
      A man under thirty needs neighbors and to stop up the current of his life
      with a long silence is like obstructing a river&mdash;eventually the water
      either sweeps away the dam or rises over it, and the stronger the dam the
      more destructive is that final rush to freedom. Vic Gregg was on the
      danger side of thirty and he lived alone in the mountains all that winter.
      He wanted to marry Betty Neal, but marriage means money, therefore Vic
      contracted fifteen hundred dollars' worth of mining for the Duncans, and
      instead of taking a partner he went after that stake single handed. He is
      a very rare man who can turn out that amount of labor in a single season,
      but Gregg furnished that exception which establishes the rule: he did the
      assessment work on fourteen claims and almost finished the fifteenth, yet
      he paid the price. Week after week his set of drills was wife and child to
      him, and for conversation he had only the clangor of the four-pound
      single-jack on the drill heads, with the crashing of the &ldquo;shots&rdquo; now and
      then as periods to the chatter of iron on iron. He kept at it, and in the
      end he almost finished the allotted work, but for all of it he paid in
      full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acid loneliness ate into him. To be sure, from boyhood he knew the
      mountain quiet, the still heights and the solemn echoes, but towards the
      close of the long isolation the end of each day found him oppressed by a
      weightier sense of burden; in a few days he would begin to talk to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first the evening pause after supper hurt him most, for a man
      needs a talk as well as tobacco, and after a time he dreaded these
      evenings so bitterly that he purposely spent himself every day, so as to
      pass from supper into sleep at a stride. It needed a long day to burn out
      his strength thoroughly, so he set his rusted alarm-clock, and before dawn
      it brought him groaning out of the blankets to cook a hasty breakfast and
      go slowly up to the tunnel. In short, he wedded himself to his work; he
      stepped into a routine which took the place of thought, and the change in
      him was so gradual that he did not see the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mirror might have shown it to him as he stood this morning at the door
      of his lean-to, for the wind fluttered the shirt around his labor-dried
      body, and his forehead puckered in a frown, grown habitual. It was a
      narrow face, with rather close-set eyes and a slanted forehead which gave
      token of a single-track mind, a single-purposed nature with one hundred
      and eighty pounds of strong sinews and iron-hard muscle to give it
      significance. Such was Vic Gregg as he stood at the door waiting for the
      coffee he had drunk to brush away the cobwebs of sleep, and then he heard
      the eagle scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great many people have never heard the scream of an eagle. The only
      voice they connect with the kind of the air is a ludicrously feeble
      squawk, dim with distance, but in his great moments the eagle has a
      war-cry like that of the hawk, but harsher, hoarser, tenfold in volume.
      This sound cut into the night in the gulch, and Vic Gregg started and
      glanced about for echoes made the sound stand at his side; then he looked
      up, and saw two eagles fighting in the light of the morning. He knew what
      it meant&mdash;the beginning of the mating season, and these two battling
      for a prize. They darted away. They flashed together with reaching talons
      and gaping beaks, and dropped in a tumult of wings, then soared and
      clashed once more until one of them folded his wings and dropped
      bulletlike out of the morning into the night. Close over Gregg's head, the
      wings flirted out&mdash;ten feet from tip to tip&mdash;beat down with a
      great washing sound, and the bird shot across the valley in a level
      flight. The conqueror screamed a long insult down the hollow. For a while
      he balanced, craning his bald head as if he sought applause, then, without
      visible movement of his wings, sailed away over the peaks. A feather
      fluttered slowly down past Vic Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down to it, and rubbed the ache out of the back of his neck. All
      about him the fresh morning was falling; yonder shone a green-mottled face
      of granite, and there a red iron blow-out streaked with veins of
      glittering silicate, and in this corner, still misted with the last
      delicate shades of night, glimmered rhyolite, lavender-pink. The
      single-jack dropped from the hand of Gregg, and his frown relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he stretched his arms, the cramps of labor unkinked and let the warm
      blood flow, swiftly, and in the pleasure of it he closed his eyes and drew
      a luxurious breath. He stepped from the door with his, head high and his
      heart lighter, and when his hobnailed shoe clinked on the fallen hammer he
      kicked it spinning from his path. That act brought a smile into his eyes,
      and he sauntered to the edge of the little plateau and looked down into
      the wide chasm of the Asper Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blue shadows washed across it, though morning shone around Gregg on the
      height, and his glance dropped in a two-thousand-foot plunge to a single
      yellow eye that winked through the darkness, a light in the trapper's
      cabin. But the dawn was falling swiftly now, and while Gregg lingered the
      blue grew thin, purple-tinted, and then dark, slender points pricked up,
      which he knew to be the pines. Last of all, he caught the sheen of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around him pressed a perfect silence, the quiet of night holding over into
      the day, yet he cast a glance behind him as he heard a voice. Indeed, he
      felt that some one approached him, some one for whom he had been waiting,
      yet it was a sad expectancy, and more like homesickness than anything he
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, hell,&rdquo; said Vic Gregg, &ldquo;it's spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep-throated echo boomed back at him, and the sound went down the
      gulch, three times repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spring,&rdquo; repeated Gregg more softly, as if he feared to rouse that echo,
      &ldquo;damned if it ain't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders and turned resolutely towards the lean-to,
      picking up the discarded hammer on the way. By instinct he caught it at
      exactly the right balance for his strength and arm, and the handle,
      polished by his grip, played with an oiled, frictionless movement against
      the callouses of his palm. From the many hours of drilling, fingers
      crooked, he could only straighten them by a painful effort. A bad hand for
      cards, he decided gloomily, and still frowning over this he reached the
      door. There he paused in instant repugnance, for the place was strange to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In thought and wish he was even now galloping Grey Molly over the grass
      along the Asper, and he had to wrench himself into the mood of the patient
      miner. There lay his blankets, rumpled, brown with dirt, and he shivered
      at sight of them; the night had been cold. Before he fell asleep, he had
      flung the magazine into the corner and now the wind rustled its torn,
      yellowed pages in a whisper that spoke to Gregg of the ten-times repeated
      stories, tales of adventure, drifts of tobacco smoke in gaming halls, the
      chant of the croupier behind the wheel, deep voices of men, laughter of
      pretty girls, tatoo of running horses, shouts which only redeye can
      inspire. He sniffed the air; odor of burned bacon and coffee permeated the
      cabin. He turned to the right and saw his discarded overalls with ragged
      holes at the knees; he turned to the left and looked into the face of the
      rusted alarm clock. Its quick, soft ticking sent an ache of weariness
      through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong with me,&rdquo; muttered Gregg. Even that voice seemed ghostly
      loud in the cabin, and he shivered again. &ldquo;I must be going nutty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if to escape from his own thoughts, he stepped out into the sun again,
      and it was so grateful to him after the chill shadow in the lean-to, that
      he looked up, smiling, into the sky. A west wind urged a scattered herd of
      clouds over the peaks, tumbled masses of white which puffed into
      transparent silver at the edges, and behind, long wraiths of vapor marked
      the path down which they had traveled. Such an old cowhand as Vic Gregg
      could not fail to see the forms of cows and heavy-necked bulls and running
      calves in that drift of clouds. About this season the boys would be
      watching the range for signs of screw worms in the cattle, and the
      bog-riders must have their hands full dragging out cows which had fled
      into the mud to escape the heel flies. With a new lonesomeness he drew his
      eyes down to the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily, strange fancies never entered the hard head of Gregg, but
      today it seemed to him that the mountains found a solemn companionship in
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the horizon, where the snowy forms glimmered in the blue, they
      marched in loose order down to the valley of the Asper, where some of them
      halted in place, huge cliffs, and others stumbled out into foothills, but
      the main range swerved to the east beside the valley, eastward out of his
      vision, though he knew that they went on to the town of Alder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alder was Vic Gregg's Athens and Rome in one, its schoolhouse his
      Acropolis, and Captain Lorrimer's saloon his Forum. Other people talked of
      larger cities, but Alder satisfied the imagination of Vic; besides, Grey
      Molly was even now in the blacksmith's pasture, and Betty Neal was
      teaching in the school. Following the march of the mountains and the drift
      of the clouds, he turned towards Alder. The piled water shook the dam,
      topped it, burst it into fragments, and rushed into freedom; he must go to
      Alder, have a drink, shake hands with a friend, kiss Betty Neal, and come
      back again. Two days going, two days coming, three days for the frolic; a
      week would cover it all. And two hours later Vic Gregg had cached his
      heavier equipment, packed his necessaries on the burro, and was on the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      By noon he had dropped below the snowline and into the foothills, and with
      every step his heart grew lighter. Behind him the mountains slid up into
      the heart of the sky with cold, white winter upon them, but here below it
      was spring indubitably. There was hardly enough fresh grass to temper the
      winter brown into shining bronze, but a busy, awakening insect life
      thronged through the roots. Surer sign than this, the flowers were coming.
      A slope of buttercups flashed suddenly when the wind struck it and wild
      morning glory spotted a stretch of daisies with purple and dainty
      lavender. To be sure, the blossoms never grew thickly enough to make
      strong dashes of color, but they tinted and stained the hillsides. He
      began to cross noisy little watercourses, empty most of the year, but now
      the melting snow fed them. From eddies and quiet pools the bright
      watercress streamed out into the currents, and now and then in moist
      ground under a sheltering bank he found rich patches of violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes went happily among these tokens of the glad time of the year, but
      while he noted them and the bursting buds of the aspen, reddish-brown, his
      mind was open to all that middle register of calls which the human ear may
      notice in wild places. Far above his scale were shrilling murmurs of birds
      and insects, and beneath it ran those ground noises that the rabbit, for
      instance, understands so well; but between these overtones and undertones
      he heard the scream of the hawk, spiraling down in huge circles, and the
      rapid call of a grouse, far off, and the drone of insects about his feet,
      or darting suddenly upon his brain and away again. He heard these things
      by the grace of the wind, which sometimes blew them about him in a chorus,
      and again shut off all except that lonely calling of the grouse, and often
      whisked away every murmur and left Gregg, in the center of a wide hush
      with only the creak of the pack-saddle and the click of the burro's
      accurate feet among the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      At such times he gave his full attention to the trail, and he read it as
      one might turn the pages of a book. He saw how a rabbit had scurried,
      running hard, for the prints of the hind feet planted far ahead of those
      on the forepaws. There was reason in her haste, for here the pads of a
      racing coyote had dug deeply into a bit of soft ground. The sign of both
      rabbit and coyote veered suddenly, and again the trail told the reason
      clearly&mdash;the big print of a lobo's paw, that gray ghost which haunts
      the ranges with the wisest brain and the swiftest feet in the West. Vic
      Gregg grinned with excitement; fifty dollars' bounty if that scalp were
      his! But the story of the trail called him back with the sign of some
      small animal which must have traveled very slowly, for in spite of the
      tiny size of the prints, each was distinct. The man sniffed with
      instinctive aversion and distrust for this was the trail of the skunk, and
      if the last of the seven sleepers was out, it was spring indeed. He raised
      his cudgel and thwacked the burro joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on, Marne,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We're overdue in Alder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marne switched her tail impatiently and canted back a long ear to listen,
      but she did not increase her pace; for Marne had only one gait, and if Vic
      occasionally thumped her, it was rather by way of conversation than in any
      hope of hurrying their journey.

    <h2>
      Chapter II. Grey Molly
    </h2>
    <p>
      If her soul had been capable of enthusiasm, Marne could have made the trip
      on schedule time, but she was a burro good for nothing except to carry a
      pack well nigh half her own weight, live on forage that might have starved
      a goat, and smell water fifteen miles in time of drought. Speed was not in
      her vocabulary, and accordingly it was late afternoon rather than morning
      when Gregg, pointing his course between the ears of Marne, steered her
      through Murphy's Pass and came out over Alder. There they paused by mutual
      consent, and the burro flicked one long ear forward to listen to the
      rushing of the Doane River. It filled the valley with continual murmur,
      and just below them, where the brown, white-flecked current twisted around
      an elbow bend, lay Alder tossed down without plan, here a boulder and
      there a house. They seemed marvelously flimsy structures, and one felt
      surprise that the weight the winter snow had not crushed them, or that the
      Doane River had not sent a strong current licking over bank and tossed the
      whole village crashing down the ravine. One building was very much like
      other, but Gregg's familiar eye pierced through the roofs and into Widow
      Sullivan's staggering shack, into Hezekiah Whittleby's hushed
      sitting-room, down to the moist, dark floor of the Captain's saloon into
      that amazing junkshop, the General Merchandise store; but first and last
      he looked to the little flag which gleamed and snapped above the
      schoolhouse, and it spelled &ldquo;my country&rdquo; to Vic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marne consented to break into a neat-footed jog-trot going down the last
      slope, and so she went up the single winding street of Alder, grunting at
      every step, with Gregg's whistle behind her. In town, he lived with his
      friend, Dug Pym, who kept their attic room reserved for his occupancy, so
      he headed straight for that place. What human face would he see first?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Sweeney's little boy, Jack, who raced into the street
      whooping, and Vic caught him under the armpits and swung him dizzily into
      the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God,&rdquo; muttered Vic, as he strode on, &ldquo;that's a good kid, that Jack.&rdquo;
       And he straightway forgot all about that knife which Jackie had purloined
      from him the summer before. &ldquo;Me and Betty,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;we'll have kids,
      like Jack; tougher'n leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Garrigan saw him next and cackled from his truck garden in the
      backyard, but Vic went on with a wave of his arm, and on past Gertie
      Vincent's inviting shout (Gertie had been his particular girl before Betty
      Neal came to town), and on with the determination of a soldier even past
      the veranda of Captain Lorrimier's saloon, though Lorrimer himself
      bellowed a greeting and &ldquo;Chick&rdquo; Stewart crooked a significant thumb over
      his shoulder towards the open door. He only paused at the blacksmith shop
      and looked in at Dug, who was struggling to make the print of a hot shoe
      on a hind foot of Simpson's sorrel Glencoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Dug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pym raised a grimy, sweating forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, boy; easy, damn you! Hello, Vic!&rdquo; and he propped that restless hind
      foot on his inner thigh and extended a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go an workin', Dug, because I can't stop; I just want a rope to catch
      Grey Molly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You red devil&mdash;take that rope over there, Vic. You won't have no
      work catchin' Molly. Which she's plumb tame. Stand still, damn you. I
      never seen a Glencoe with any sense!&mdash;Where you goin', Vic? Up to the
      school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And his sweaty grin followed Vic as the latter went out with the coil of
      rope over his shoulder. When Gregg reached the house, Nelly Pym hugged
      him, which is the privilege of fat and forty, and then she sat at the foot
      of the stairs and shouted up gossip while he shaved with frantic haste and
      jumped into his best clothes. He answered her with monosyllables and only
      half his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish up your work, Vic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sure worked yourself all thin. I hope somebody appreciates it.&rdquo; She
      chuckled. &ldquo;Ain't been sick, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, who d'you think's in town? Sheriff Glass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This information sank in on him while he tugged at a boot at least a size
      and half too small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete Glass!&rdquo; he echoed. Then: &ldquo;Who's he after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno. Vic, he don't look like such a bad one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's plenty bad enough,&rdquo; Gregg assured her. &ldquo;Ah-h-h!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His foot ground into place, torturing his toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; considered Mrs. Pym, in a philosophic rumble, &ldquo;I s'pose them
      quiet gents is the dangerous ones, mostly; but looking at Glass you
      wouldn't think he'd ever killed all those men. Know about the dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down to Singer's place. Betty goin' with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jerked open the door and barked down at her: &ldquo;Who else would she be
      goin' with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't start pullin' leather before the horse bucks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pym. &ldquo;I
      don't know who else she'd be goin' with. You sure look fine in that red
      shirt, Vic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grinned, half mollified, half shame-faced, and ducked back into the
      room, but a moment later he clumped stiffly down the stairs, frowning. He
      wondered if he could dance in those boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feel kind of strange in these clothes. How do I look, Nelly?&rdquo; And he
      turned in review at the foot of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slick as a whistle, I'll tell a man.&rdquo; She raised her voice to a shout as
      he disappeared through the outer door. &ldquo;Kiss her once for me, Vic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the center of the little pasture he stood shaking out the noose, and
      the three horses raced in a sweeping gallop around the fence, looking for
      a place of escape, with Grey Molly in the lead. Nothing up the Doane
      River, or even down the Asper, for that matter, could head Molly when she
      was full of running, and the eyes of Gregg gleamed as he watched her. She
      was not a picture horse, for her color was rather a dirty white than a
      dapple, and besides, there were some who accused her of &ldquo;tucked up belly.&rdquo;
       But she had the legs for speed in spite of the sloping croup, and plenty
      of chest at the girth, and a small, bony head that rejoiced the heart of a
      horseman. He swung the noose, and while the others darted ahead, stupidly
      straight into the range of danger, Grey Molly whirled like a doubling
      coyote and leaped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo; cried Vic, in involuntary approbation. He ran a few steps.
      The noose slid up and out, opened in a shaky loop, and swooped down. Too
      late the gray saw the flying danger, for even as she swerved the riata
      fell over her head, and she came to a snorting halt with all fours
      planted, skidding through the grass. The first thing a range horse learns
      is never to pull against a rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later she was getting the &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; out of her system, as any
      self-respecting cattle horse must do after a session of pasture and no
      work. She bucked with enthusiasm and intelligence, as she did all things.
      Sun-fishing, sun-fishing is the most deadly form of bucking, for it
      consists of a series of leaps apparently aimed at the sun, and the horse
      comes down with a sickening jar on stiff front legs. Educated &ldquo;pitchers&rdquo;
       land on only one foot, so that the shock is accompanied by a terrible
      sidewise, downward wrench that breaks the hearts of the best riders in the
      world. Grey Molly was educated, and Mrs. Pym stood in the doorway with a
      broad grin of appreciation on her red face, she knew riding when she saw
      it. Then, out of the full frenzy, the mare lapsed into high-headed,
      quivering attention, and Gregg cursed her softly, with deep affection. He
      understood her from her fetlocks to her teeth. She bucked like a fiend of
      revolt one instant and cantered like an angel of grace the next; in fact
      she was more or less of an equine counterpart of her rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he heard shrill voices passing down the street and he knew that
      school was out and that he must hurry if he wanted to ride home with
      Betty, so he waved to Mrs. Pym and cantered away. For over two days he had
      been rushing towards this meeting; all winter he had hungered for it, but
      now that the moment loomed before him he weakened; he usually did when he
      came close to the girl. Not that her beauty overwhelmed him, for though
      she had a portion of energetic good-health and freckled prettiness, he had
      chosen her as an Indian chooses flint for his steel; one could strike fire
      from Betty Neal. When he was far away he loved her without doubt or
      question and his trust ran towards her like a river setting towards the
      ocean because he knew that her heart was as big and as true as the heart
      of Grey Molly herself. Only her ways were fickle, and when she came near,
      she filled him with uneasiness, suspicion.

    <h2>
      Chapter III. Battle
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the road he passed Miss Brewster&mdash;for the Alder school boasted two
      teachers!&mdash;and under her kindly, rather faded smile he felt a great
      desire to stop and take her into his confidence; ask her what Betty Neal
      had been doing all these months. Instead, he touched Grey Molly with the
      spurs, and she answered like a watch-spring uncurling beneath him. The
      rush of wind against his face raised his spirits to a singing pitch, and
      when he flung from the saddle before the school he shouted: &ldquo;Oh, Betty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up the sharply angling steps in a bound, and at the door: &ldquo;Oh, Betty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice filled the room with a thick, dull echo, and there was Betty
      behind her desk looking up at him agape; and beside her stood Blondy
      Hansen, big, good looking, and equally startled. Fear made the glance of
      Vic Gregg swerve&mdash;to where little Tommy Aiken scribbled an arithmetic
      problem on the blackboard&mdash;afterschool work for whispering in class,
      or some equally heinous crime. The tingling voices of the other children
      on their way home, floated in to Tommy, and the corners of his mouth
      drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      To regain his poise, Vic tugged at his belt and felt the weight of the
      holster slipping into a more convenient place, then he sauntered up the
      aisle, sweeping off his sombrero. Every feeling in his body, every nerve,
      disappeared in a crystalline hardness, for it seemed to him that the air
      was surcharged by a secret something between Betty and young Hansen. Betty
      was out from behind her desk and she ran to meet him and took his hand in
      both of hers. The rush of her coming took his breath, and at her touch
      something melted in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Vic, are you all through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregg stiffened for the benefit of Hansen and Tommy Aiken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty near through,&rdquo; he said carelessly. &ldquo;Thought I'd drop down to Alder
      for a day or two and get the kinks out. Hello, Blondy. Hey, Tommy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tommy Aiken flashed a grin at him, but Tommy was not quite sure that the
      rules permitted speaking, even under such provocation as the return of Vic
      Gregg, so he maintained a desperate silence. Blondy had picked up his hat
      as he returned the greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'll be going,&rdquo; he said, and coughed to show that he was
      perfectly at ease, but it seemed to Vic that it was hard for Blondy to
      meet his eye when they shook hands. &ldquo;See you later, Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; She smiled at Vic&mdash;a flash&mdash;and then gathered
      dignity of both voice and manner. &ldquo;You may go now, Tommy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lapsed into complete unconsciousness of manner as Tommy swooped on his
      desk, included hat and book in one grab, and darted towards the door
      through which Hansen had just disappeared. Here he paused, tilting, and
      his smile twinkled at them with understanding. &ldquo;Good-night, Miss Neal.
      Hope you have a good time, Vic.&rdquo; His heel clicked twice on the steps
      outside, and then the patter of his racing feet across the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little mischief!&rdquo; said Betty, delightfully flushed. &ldquo;It beats
      everything, Vic, how Alder takes things for granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He should have taken her in his arms and kissed her, now that she had
      cleared the room, he very well knew, but the obvious thing was always last
      to come in Gregg's repertoire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not take it for granted? It ain't going to be many days, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her eyes sparkle, but the pleasure of seeing him drowned the
      gleam almost at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really almost through? Oh, Vic, you've been away so long, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
       She checked herself. There was no overflow of sentiment in Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I was a fool for laying off work this way,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but I
      sure got terrible lonesome up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her glance went over him contentedly, from the hard brown hands to the
      wrinkle which labor had sunk in the exact center of his forehead. He was
      all man, to Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on along,&rdquo; he said. He would kiss her by surprise as they reached
      the door. &ldquo;Come on along. It's sure enough spring outside. I been eating
      it up, and&mdash;we can do our talking over things at the dance. Let's
      ride now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, down to Singer's place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to be kind of hard to get out of going with Blondy. He asked
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you said you'd go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you flarin' up about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, how long have you been traipsin' around with Blondy Hansen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clenched one hand beside her in a way he knew, but it pleased him more
      than it warned him, just as it pleased him to see the ears of Grey Molly
      go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong about Blondy Hansen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's right about him?&rdquo; he countered senselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice went a bit shrill. &ldquo;Blondy is a gentleman, I'll have you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you sneer at me, Victor Gregg. I won't have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he was pushing her to the danger point, but she was
      perfectly, satisfyingly beautiful in her anger; he taunted her with the
      pleasure of an artist painting a picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't!&rdquo; she repeated. Something else came to her lips, but she
      repressed it, and he could see the pressure from within telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't get in a huff over nothing,&rdquo; he urged, in real alarm. &ldquo;Only, it
      made me kind of mad to see Blondy standing there with that calf-look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What calf-look? He's a lot better to look at than you'll ever be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smear of red danced before the vision of Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't set up for no beauty prize. Tie a pink ribbon in Blondy's hair
      and take him to a baby show if you want. He's about young enough to
      enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she could have found a ready retort her anger might have passed away in
      words, but no words came, and she turned pale. It was here that Gregg made
      his crucial mistake, for he thought the pallor came from fear, fear which
      his sham jealousy had roused in her, perhaps. He should have maintained a
      discreet silence, but instead, he poured in the gall of complacency upon a
      raw wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blondy's all right,&rdquo; he stated beneficently, &ldquo;but you just forget about
      him tonight. You're going to that dance, and you're going with me. If
      there's any explanations to be made, you leave 'em to me. I'll handle
      Blondy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You handle Blondy!&rdquo; she whispered. Her voice came back; it rang: &ldquo;You
      couldn't if he had one hand tied behind him.&rdquo; She measured him for another
      blow. &ldquo;I'm going to that dance and I'm going with Mr. Hansen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew that he would have died for her, and he knew that she would have
      died for him; accordingly they abandoned themselves to sullen fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're out of date, Vic,&rdquo; she ran on. &ldquo;Men can't drag women around
      nowadays, and you can't drag me. Not&mdash;one&mdash;inch.&rdquo; She put a
      vicious little interval between each of the last three words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be calling for you at seven o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll call on Blondy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't dare to. Don't you try to bluff me. I'm not that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty, d'you mean that? D'you think that I'm yaller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you calm and impersonal, just think that over before you say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've already thought it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by God,&rdquo; said Gregg, trembling, &ldquo;I'll never take one step out of my
      way to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, so blind with fury that he shouldered the door on his way out
      and so, into the saddle, with Grey Molly standing like a figure of rock,
      as if she sensed his mood. He swung her about on her hind legs with a
      wrench on the curb and a lift of his spurs, but when she leaped into a
      gallop he brought her back to the walk with a cruel jerk; she began to
      sidle across the field with her chin drawn almost back to her breast,
      prancing. That movement of the horse brought him half way around towards
      the door and he was tempted mightily to look, for he knew that Betty Neal
      was standing there, begging him with her eyes. But the great, sullen pain
      conquered; he straightened out the mare for the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was indeed at the door, leaning against it in a sudden weakness, and
      even in her pain she felt pride in the grace and skill of Vic's
      horsemanship. The hearts of both of them were breaking, with this rather
      typical difference: that Gregg felt her to be entirely at fault, and that
      she as fully accepted every scruple of the blame. He had come down tired
      out and nervous from work he had done for her sake, she remembered, and if
      he would only glance back once&mdash;he must know that she was praying for
      it&mdash;she would cry out and run down to him; but he went on, on,
      through the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flash of her passion returned to her. &ldquo;I shall go with Blondy&mdash;if
      it kills me.&rdquo; And she flung herself into the nearest seat and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when he reached the road and looked back at last, the doorway yawned
      black, empty, and he set his teeth with a groan and spurred down the road
      for Alder. He drew rein at Captain Lorrimer's and entered with curt nods
      in exchange for the greetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red-eye,&rdquo; he ordered, and seized bottle and glass as Lorrimer spun them
      deftly towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lorrimer picked up the bottle and gazed at it mournfully when Vic
      had poured his drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;you've sure raised an awful thirst.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter IV. King Hol
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a very general and very erroneous impression that alcohol builds
      the mood of a man; as a matter of fact it merely makes his temper of the
      moment fast&mdash;the man who takes his first drink with a smile ends in
      uproarious laughter, and he who frowns will often end in fighting. Vic
      Gregg did not frown as he drank, but the corners of his lips turned up a
      trifle in a smile of fixed and acid pleasantry and his glance went from
      face to face in the barroom, steadily, with a trifling pause at each pair
      of eyes. Beginning with himself, he hated mankind in general; the burn of
      the cheap whisky within served to set the color of that hatred in a fixed
      dye. He did not lift his chaser, but his hand closed around it hard. If
      some one had given him an excuse for a fist-fight or an outburst of
      cursing it would have washed his mind as clean as a new slate, and five
      minutes later he might have been with Betty Neal, riotously happy.
      Instead, everyone overflowed with good nature, gossip, questions about his
      work, and the danger in him crystallized. He registered cold reasons for
      his disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning in the first person, he loathed himself as a thick-headed ass
      for talking to Betty as he had done; as well put a burr under one's saddle
      and then feel surprise because the horse bucks. He passed on to the others
      with equal precision. Captain Lorrimer was as dirty as a greaser; and like
      a greaser, loose-lipped, unshaven. Chick Stewart was a born fool, and a
      fool by self-culture, as his never changing grin amply proved. Lew Perkins
      sat in the corner on a shaky old apple barrel and brushed back his long
      mustaches to spit at the cuspidor&mdash;and miss it. If this were Vic
      Gregg's saloon he would teach the old loafer more accuracy or break his
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Gregg?&rdquo; murmured some one behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and found Sheriff Pete Glass with his right hand already spread
      on the bar while he ordered a drink for two. That was one of the sheriff's
      idiosyncrasies; he never shook hands if he could avoid it, and Gregg hated
      him senselessly, bitterly, for it. No doubt every one in the room noticed,
      and they would tell afterwards how the sheriff had avoided shaking hands
      with Vic Gregg. Cheap play for notoriety, thought Gregg; Glass was pushing
      the bottle towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo; said Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is on me, Vic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I most generally like to buy the first drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete Glass turned his head slowly, for indeed all his motions were
      leisurely and one could not help wondering at the stories of his exploits,
      the tales of his hair-trigger alertness. Perhaps these half legendary
      deeds sent the thrill of uneasiness through Vic Gregg; perhaps it was
      owing to the singular hazel eyes, with little splotches of red in them;
      very mild eyes, but one could imagine anything about them. Otherwise there
      was nothing exceptional in Glass, for he stood well under middle height, a
      starved figure, with a sinewy crooked neck, as if bent on looking up to
      taller men. His hair was sandy, his face tawny brown, his shirt a gray
      blue, and every one knew his dusty roan horse; by nature, by temperament
      and by personal selection he was suited to blend into a landscape of
      sage-dotted plains or sand. Tireless as a lobo on the trail, swift as a
      bobcat in fight, hunted men had been known to ride in and give themselves
      up when they heard that Pete Glass was after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway you want, partner,&rdquo; he was saying, in his soft, rather husky
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He poured his drink, barely enough to cover the bottom of his glass, for
      that was another of Pete's ways; he could never afford to weaken his hand
      or deaden his eye with alcohol, and even now he stood sideways at the bar,
      facing Gregg and also facing the others in the room. But the larger man,
      with sudden scorn for this caution, brimmed his own glass, and poised it
      swiftly. &ldquo;Here's how!&rdquo; and down it went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily red-eye heated his blood and made his brain dizzy, it loosened
      his tongue and numbed his lips, but today it left him cool, confident, and
      sharpened his vision until he felt that he could see through the minds of
      every one in the room. Captain Lorrimer, for instance, was telling a
      jocular story to Chick Stewart in the hope that Chick would set them up
      for every one; and old Lew Perkins was waiting for the treat; and perhaps
      the sheriff was wondering how he could handle Vic in case of need, or how
      long it would take to run him down. Not long, decided Gregg, breathing
      hard; no man in the world could put him on the run. Glass was treating in
      turn, and again the brimming drink went down Vic's throat and left his
      brain clear, wonderfully clear. He saw through Betty Neal now; she had
      purposely played off Blondy against him, to make them both jealous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you join us, Dad?&rdquo; the sheriff was saying to Lew Perkins, and Vic
      Gregg smiled. He understood. The sheriff wanted an excuse to order another
      round of drinks because he had it in mind to intoxicate Gregg; perhaps
      Glass had something on him; perhaps the manhunter thought that Vic had had
      a part in that Wilsonville affair two years back. That was it, and he
      wanted to make Vic talk when he was drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mind if I do,&rdquo; Lew said, slapping both hands on the bar as if he
      owned it; and while he waited for his drink: &ldquo;What are they going to do
      with Swain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doddering idiot! Swain was the last man Glass had taken, and Lew
      Perkins should have known that the sheriff never talked about his work;
      the old ass was in his green age, his second childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swain turned state's evidence,&rdquo; said Pete, curtly. &ldquo;He'll go free, I
      suppose. Fill up your glass, partner. Can see you're thirsty yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was to Gregg, who had purposely poured out a drink of the sheriff's
      own chosen dimension to see if the latter would notice; this remark fixed
      his suspicions. It was certain that the manhunter was after him, but
      again, in scorn, he accepted the challenge and poured a stiff dram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; nodded the sheriff. &ldquo;You got nothing on your shoulders.
      You can let yourself go, Vic. Sometimes I wish&rdquo;&mdash;he sighed&mdash;&ldquo;I
      wish I could do the same!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sneaky coyote,&rdquo; thought Gregg, &ldquo;he's lurin' me on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turned state's evidence!&rdquo; maundered Lew Perkins. &ldquo;Well, they's a lot of
      'em that lose their guts when they're caught. I remember way back in the
      time when Bannack was runnin' full blast&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why did not some one shut off the old idiot before he was thoroughly
      started? He might keep on talking like the clank of a windmill in a steady
      breeze, endlessly. For Lew was old-seventy-five, eighty, eighty-five&mdash;he
      himself probably did not know just how old&mdash;and he had lived through
      at least two generations of pioneers with a myriad stories about them. He
      could string out tales of the Long Trail: Abilene, Wichita, Ellsworth,
      Great Bend, Newton, where eleven men were murdered in one night; he knew
      the vigilante days in San Francisco, and early times in Alder Gulch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody would of thought Plummer was yaller, but he turned out that way,&rdquo;
       droned on the narrator. &ldquo;Grit? He had enough to fit out twenty men. When
      Crawford shot him and busted his right arm, he went right on and learned
      to shoot with his left and started huntin' Jack again. Packed that lead
      with him till he died, and then they found Jack's bullet in his wrist, all
      worked smooth by the play of the bones. Afterwards it turned out that
      Plummer ran a whole gang; but before we learned that we'd been fools
      enough to make him sheriff. We got to Plummer right after he'd finished
      hangin' a man, and took him to his own gallows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd of thought a cool devil like that would of made a good end, but he
      didn't. He just got down on his knees and cried, and asked God to help
      him. Then he begged us to give him time to pray, but one of the boys up
      and told him he could do his prayin' from the cross-beam. And that was
      Henry Plummer, that killed a hundred men, him an' his gang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-m-m,&rdquo; murmured the sheriff, and looked uneasily about. Now that his
      eyes were turned away, Vic could study him at leisure, and he wondered at
      the smallness of the man. Suppose one were able to lay hands on him it
      would be easy to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you later, boys,&rdquo; drawled Glass, and sauntered from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lew Perkins sighed as the most important part of his audience disappeared,
      but having started talking the impetus carried him along, he held Vic
      Gregg with his hazy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they didn't all finish like Plummer, not all the bad ones. No sirree!
      There was Boone Helm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard about him,&rdquo; growled Vic, but the old man had fixed his glance
      and his reminiscent smile upon the past and his voice was soft with
      distance when he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helm was a sure enough bad one, son. They don't grow like him no more.
      Wild Bill was a baby compared with Helm, and Slade wasn't no man at all,
      even leavin' in the lies they tell about him. Why, son, Helm was just a
      lobo, in the skin of a man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Barry?&rdquo; put in Lorrimer, drifting closer down the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you heard of Whistlin' Dan? The one that killed Jim Silent and
      busted up his gang. Why, they say he's got a wolf that he can talk to like
      it was a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Lew chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say a lot of things,&rdquo; he nodded, &ldquo;but I'll tell a man that a wolf is
      a wolf and they ain't nothin' that can tame 'em. Don't you let 'em feed
      you up on lies like that, Lorrimer. But Helm was sure bad. He killed for
      the sake of killin', but he died game. When the boys run him down he swore
      on the bible that he's never killed a man, and they made him swear it over
      again just to watch his nerve; but he never batted an eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The picture of that wild time grew up for Vic Gregg, and the thought of
      free men who laughed at the law, strong men, fierce men. What would one of
      these have done if the girl he intended to marry had treated him like a
      foil?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they got him ready for the rope,&rdquo; went on Lew Perkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I've seen a tolerable lot of death,' says Helm. 'I ain't afraid of it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was about six thousand folks had come in to see the end of Boone
      Helm. Somebody asked him if he wanted anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Whisky,' says Boone. And he got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he shook his hand and held it up. He had a sore finger and it
      bothered him a lot more than the thought of hangin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You gents get through with this or else tie up my finger,' he kept
      sayin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helm wasn't the whole show. There was some others bein' hung that day and
      when one of them dropped off his box, Boone says: 'There's one gone to
      hell.' Pretty soon another went, and hung there wiggling, and six times he
      went through all the motions of pullin' his six-shooter and firin' it. I
      counted. 'Kick away, old fellow,' says Boone Helm, 'I'll be with you
      soon.' Then it came his turn and he hollered: 'Hurrah for Jeff Davis; let
      her rip!' That was how Boone Helm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the story was blotted from the mind of Vic Gregg by the thud
      of a heavy heel on the veranda, and then the broad shoulders of Blondy
      Hansen darkened the doorway, Blondy Hansen dressed for the dance, with the
      knot of his black silk handkerchief turned to the front and above that the
      gleam of his celluloid collar. It was dim in the saloon, compared with the
      brightness of the outdoors, and perhaps Blondy did not see Vic. At any
      rate he took his place at the other end of the bar. Three pictures tangled
      in the mind of Gregg like three bodies in a whirlpool&mdash;Betty, Blondy,
      Pete Glass. That strange clearness of perception increased and the whole
      affair lay plainly before him. Betty had sent Hansen, dressed manifestly
      for the festival, to gloat over Vic in Lorrimer's place. He was at it
      already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All turned out for the dance, Blondy, eh? Takin' a girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty Neal,&rdquo; answered Blondy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell you are!&rdquo; inquired Lorrimer, mildly astonished. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;why,
      Vic's back in town, don't you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't got a mortgage on what she does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, guided by the side-glance of Lorrimer, Hansen saw Gregg, and he
      stiffened. As for Vic, he perceived the last link in his chain of
      evidence. Hansen was going to a dance, and yet he wore a gun, and there
      could be only one meaning in that: Betty had sent him down there to wind
      up the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't see you, Vic,&rdquo; Blondy was saying, his flushed face seeming doubly
      red against the paleness of his hair. &ldquo;Have something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't drinkin',&rdquo; answered Gregg, and slowly, to make sure that no one
      could miss his meaning, he poured out a glass of liquor, and drank it with
      his face towards Hansen. When he put his glass down his mind was clearer
      than ever; and with omniscient precision, with nerveless calm, he knew
      that he was going to kill Blondy Hansen; knew exactly where the bullet
      would strike. It was something put behind him; his mind had already seen
      Hansen fall, and he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead silence had fallen over the room, and in the silence Gregg heard a
      muffled, ticking sound, the beating of his heart; heard old Lew Perkins as
      the latter softly, slowly, glided back out of the straight line of danger;
      heard the quick breathing of Captain Lorrimer who stood pasty pale, gaping
      behind the bar; heard the gritted teeth of Blondy Hansen, who would not
      take water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic,&rdquo; said Blondy, &ldquo;it looks like you mean trouble. Anyway, you just now
      done something that needs explaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood straight as a soldier, rigid, but the fingers of his right hand
      twitched, twitched, twitched; the hand itself stole higher. Very calmly,
      Vic hunted for his words, found them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cattle rustler is bad,&rdquo; he pronounced, &ldquo;a hoss thief is worse, but
      you're the lowest sneak of the lot, Blondy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again that silence with the pulse in it, and Vic Gregg could feel the
      chill which numbed every one except himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lower jaw of Captain Lorrimer sagged, and his whisper came out in
      jerking syllables: &ldquo;God Almighty!&rdquo; Then Blondy went for his gun, and Vic
      waited with his hand on the butt of his own, waited with a perfect, cold
      foreknowledge, heard Blondy moan as his Colt hung in the holster, saw the
      flash of the barrel as it whipped out, and then jerked his own weapon and
      fired from the hip. Blondy staggered but kept himself from falling by
      gripping the edge of the bar with his left hand; the right, still holding
      the gun, raised and rubbed across his forehead; he looked like a sleeper
      awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a sound from any one else, while Vic watched the tiny wraith of smoke
      jerk up from the muzzle of his revolver. Then Blondy's gun flashed down
      and clanked on the floor. A red spot grew on the breast of Hansen's shirt;
      now he leaned as if to pick up something, but instead, slid forward on his
      face. Vic stepped to him and stirred the body with his toe; it wobbled,
      limp.

    <h2>
      Chapter V. The Fight
    </h2>
    <p>
      There were three spots of white in the dim saloon, the faces of Stewart,
      Lorrimer, and old Lew Perkins, and at the feet of Vic grew a spot of red.
      Knowing with calm surety that no hand would lift against him even if he
      turned his back, he walked out the door without a word and swung into the
      saddle. There, for an instant, he calculated chances, for the street
      stretched empty before and behind with not a sound of warning stirring in
      the saloon. He was greatly tempted to ride to Dug Pym's for his blanket
      roll and a few other traveling necessities, but he remembered that the men
      of Alder rose to action with astonishing speed; within five minutes a
      group of hard riders would be clattering up his trail with Pete Glass at
      their head. An unlucky Providence had sent Pete to Alder on this day of
      all days. There stood his redoubtable dusty roan at the hitching rack, her
      head low, one ear back and one flopped forward, her under lip pendulous&mdash;in
      a pasture full of horses one might pick her last either for stout heart or
      speed. Even in spite of her history Vic would have engaged Grey Molly to
      beat the roan at equal weights, but since he outbulked the sheriff full
      forty pounds, he weighed in nice balance the necessity of shooting the
      roan before he left Alder. It was, he decided, unpleasant but vital, and
      his fingers had already slid around the butt of his gun when a horse
      whinnied far off and the roan twitched up her head to listen. She was no
      longer a cloddish lump of horseflesh, but an individual, a soul; Gregg's
      hand fell from his gun. Cursing his sentimental weakness, he lifted Molly
      into a canter down the street. Still no signs of awakening behind him or
      about; only little Jack Sweeney playing tag with a black-and-tan puppy,
      the triumphant cackle of a hen somewhere to the left; but as he neared the
      end of the street, where the trail swung into the rocks of the slope, a
      door banged far off and a voice was screaming: &ldquo;Pete! Pete Glass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grey Molly switched her tail nervously at the shout, but Vic was too wise
      to let her waste strength hurrying up so sharp a declivity; that dusty
      roan whose life he had spared would be spending it prodigally to overtake
      him before long and Molly's power must be husbanded. So he kept her at a
      quick walk by pressing the calf of one leg into her flank and turned in
      the saddle to watch the town sink behind him. Sometime in the vague,
      stupid past Marne had jog-trotted down this slope, but now he was a new
      man with an eye which saw all things and a gun which could not fail.
      Figures, singularly tiny and singularly distinct, swarmed into the street
      from nowhere, men on horses, men swinging into saddles; here and there the
      slant light of the afternoon twinkled on gun barrels, and ludicrous thin
      voices came piping up the hill. As he reached the nether lip of Murphy's
      Pass a small cavalcade detached itself from the main mass before Captain
      Lorrimer's saloon and swept down the street, first a dusty figure on a
      dusty horse, hardly visible; then a spot of red which must be Harry Fisher
      on his blood-bay, with a long-striding sorrel beside him that could carry
      no one except grim old Sliver Waldron. Behind these rode one with the
      light glinting on his silver conchos&mdash;Mat Henshaw, the town Beau
      Brummel&mdash;then the black Guss Reeve, and last of all &ldquo;Ronicky&rdquo; Joe on
      his pinto; &ldquo;Ronicky&rdquo; Joe, handy man at all things, and particularly guns.
      It showed how fast Pete Glass could work and how well he knew Alder, for
      Vic himself could not have selected five cooler fighters among the
      villagers or five finer mounts. The posse switched around the end of the
      street and darted up the hill like the curling lash of a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Vic Gregg. &ldquo;The damn fools will wind their horses before they
      hit the pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put Grey Molly into an easy trot, for the floor of the pass dipped up
      and down, littered with sharp-toothed rocks or treacherous, rolling ones,
      as bad a place for speed as a stiff upslope. According to his nicest
      calculation the posse could not reach the edge of the gulch before he was
      at the farther side, out of range of everything except a long chance shot,
      so he took note of things as he went and observed a spot of pale silver
      skirting through the brush on the eastern ridge of the gorge. There would
      be moonlight that night and another chance in favor of Pete Glass. He
      remembered then, with quiet content, that jogging in the holster was a
      power which with six words might stop those six pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long halloo came barking down the pass, now drawling out, now cut away
      to silence as the angling cliffs sent on the echo, and Vic loosened the
      rein. Grey Molly swung out with a snort of relief to a free-swinging
      gallop and they swept down a great, gentle slope where new grass padded
      the fall of her hoofs, yet even then he kept the mare checked and held her
      in touch with an easily playing wrist. He did not imagine that even the
      sheriff on the dusty roan would dream of trying to swallow up Grey Molly
      in a short sprint but that assurance nearly cost Vic his life. The roar of
      hoofs in the gulch belched out into the comparative silence of the open
      space beyond and just as he gave the mare her head a gun coughed and an
      angry humming darted past his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly lengthened into full speed. He could not tell on account of the
      muffling grass whether the pursuit was gaining or losing. He trusted
      blindly to the mare and when he looked back they were already pulling
      their mounts down to a hand gallop. That would teach them to match Molly
      in a sprint, roan or no roan!
    </p>
    <p>
      He slapped her below the withers, where the long, hard muscles rippled
      back and forth. She was full of running, her gallop as light as the toss
      of a bough in the wind, and now as he pulled her back to a swinging canter
      her head went high, with pricking ears. Suddenly his heart went out to
      her; she would run like that till she died, he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good girl,&rdquo; he whispered huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was paling towards the end when he headed into the foothills of
      the White Mountains. He drew up Molly for a breath on a level shoulder.
      Already he was close to the snow line with ragged heads of white rearing
      above him. Far below, a pale streak of moonlight was the Asper. Then, out
      of that blacker night on the slopes beneath, he heard the clinking hoofs
      of the posse; the quiet was so perfect, the air so clear, that he even
      caught the chorus of straining saddle leather and then voices of men. All
      this time the effects of the whisky had been wearing away by imperceptible
      degrees and at that sound all his old self rushed back on Vic Gregg. Why,
      they were his friends, his partners, these voices in the night, and that
      clear laughter floated up from Harry Fisher who had been his bunkie at the
      Circle V Bar ranch three years ago. He felt an insane impulse to lean over
      the edge of the cliff and shout a greeting.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI. The Rifle
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dawn found him over the first crest; at noon he was struggling up the
      slope of the second range, whose rise was not half so sharp as the upward
      plunge out of the Asper, but in spite of that easier ground Grey Molly
      could not gain. She went with shorter steps, now, and her head hung lower
      and lower, yet when a down stretch opened before her she went at it with a
      gallop as light, almost, as her race out of Murphy's Pass. Not once had
      she offered to stop; not once had she winced from the labor of some sharp
      up-pitch; but still six horsemen hung behind her, and at their head rode a
      little dusty man on a little dusty roan. It was the lack of training as
      well as the rough going which held Molly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that second range, however, the down slope stretched smoothly,
      evenly, for mile on mile and mile on mile; perfect going for Grey Molly
      over easy hills with patches of forest here and there where he might
      double, or where he might stop with the hunt sweeping past. All this the
      sheriff must have known perfectly well, for he no longer kept back with
      his pack of five, but skirted on ahead, hunting alone. Again and again Vic
      heard the little shrill whistle with which Pete Glass encouraged the roan.
      Vic used the spurs twice, and then he desisted from the useless brutality
      for Molly was doing her best and no power on earth could make her do more.
      After all, her best would be good enough, for now Vic looked up and his
      heart leaped into his throat; there was only one more rise above him, and
      beyond lay the easy ground and a running chance for Molly's slender legs.
      Even as he raised his head something whined evilly over him, followed by a
      sound like two heavy hammers swung together, face to face, and shattered
      by the stroke. A rifle!
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked back, saw the roan standing broadside towards him, watched the
      sun waver and then flash in a straight steady line along the barrel of the
      sheriff's gun. The line of light jerked up, and before the sound reached
      him a blow on his right shoulder sent Vic lurching forward against the
      pommel. Afterwards the voice of the rifle rang around him and a sharp pain
      twitched up and down his side, then ran tingling to his fingertips.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the stunning blow which saved him, for the sheriff had the range
      and his third bullet would have clipped Vic between the shoulders, but
      Glass had seen his quarry pitch forward in the saddle and he would not
      waste ammunition. The thrift of his New England ancestry spoke in Pete now
      and then and he could only grit his teeth when he saw Vic, disappearing on
      the other side of the crest, straighten in the saddle; the next instant
      the top of the hill shielded the fugitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well and nobly, then, Grey Molly repaid all the praise, all the tenderness
      and care which Vic had lavished upon her in the past years, for with her
      legs shaking from the struggle of that last climb, with a rider who
      wobbled crazily in his seat, with reins hanging loose on her neck, with
      not even a voice to guide or to encourage her, she swept straight across
      the falling ground, gaining strength and courage at every stride. By the
      time Vic had regained his self-control and rallied a little from that
      first terrible falling of the heart, the dusty roan was over the crest and
      streaking after the game. Grey Molly gained steadily, yet even when he
      gathered the reins in his left hand Vic knew that the fight was done, in
      effect. How could he double or dodge when his own blood spotted the trail
      he kept, and how long could he keep the saddle with the agony which tore
      like saw teeth at his shoulder?
    </p>
    <p>
      Grey Molly plunged straight into the shadow of pine trees, and the cool
      gloom fell like a blessing upon Vic in his torment; it was heaven to be
      sheltered even for a few moments from the eyes of the posse. At the
      opposite edge of the wood he drew rein with a groan. Some devil had
      prompted Gus Reeve and some devil had poured Reeve's horse full of
      strength, for yonder down the valley, not a hundred yards away, galloped a
      rider on a black horse; yet Vic could have sworn that when he looked back
      from the crest he had seen Gus riding the very last in the posse. An
      instant later the illusion vanished, for the black horse of Gus was never
      an animal such as this, never had this marvelous, long gait. Its feet
      flicked the earth and shot it along with a reaching stride so easy, so
      flowing that only the fluttered mane and the tail stretching straight
      behind gave token of the speed. For the rest, it carried its head high,
      with pricking ears, the sure sign of a horse running well within his
      strength, yet Grey Molly, fresh and keen for racing, could hardly have
      kept pace with the black as it slid over the hills. God in heaven, if such
      a horse were his a thousand sheriffs on a thousand dusty roans could never
      take him; five minutes would sweep him out of sight and reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the horseman ran a tall dog, wolfish in head and wolfish in the
      gait which carried it like a cloud shadow over the ground, but it was
      over-large for any wolf Vic had ever seen. It turned its head now, and
      leaped aside at sight of the stranger, but the rider veered from his
      course and swept down on Vic. He came to a halt close up without either a
      draw at the reins or a spoken word, probably controlling his mount with
      pressure of the knees, and Gregg found himself facing a delicately
      handsome fellow. He was neither cowpuncher nor miner, Vic knew at a
      glance, for that face had never been haggard with labor. A tenderfoot,
      probably, in spite of his dress, and Vic felt that if his right arm were
      sound he could take that horse at the point of his gun and leave the rider
      thanking God that his life had been spared; but his left hand was useless
      on the butt of a revolver, and three minutes away came the posse, racing.
      There was only time for one desperate appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; he burst out, &ldquo;I'm follered. I got to have your hoss. Take
      this one in exchange; it's the best I ever threw a leg over. Here's two
      hundred bucks&mdash;&rdquo; he flung his wallet on the ground and swung himself
      out of the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wolfish dog, which had growled softly all this time and roughed up the
      hair of its neck, now slunk forward on its belly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heel, Bart!&rdquo; commanded the stranger sharply, and the dog whipped about
      and stood away, whining with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Gregg's feet struck the ground his legs buckled like saplings
      in a wind for the long ride had sapped his strength, and the flow of blood
      told rapidly on him now. The hills and trees whirled around him until a
      lean, strong hand caught him under either armpit. The stranger stood
      close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could have my hoss if you could ride him,&rdquo; said he. His voice was
      singularly unhurried and gentle. &ldquo;But you'd drop out of the saddle in ten
      minutes. Who's after you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice shouted far off beyond the wood; another voice answered, nearer,
      and the whole soul of Gregg turned to the stallion. Grey Molly was blown,
      she stood now with hanging head and her flanks sunk in alarmingly at every
      breath, but even fresh from the pasture she was not a rag, not a straw
      compared to the black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake,&rdquo; groaned Vic, &ldquo;loan me your hoss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't stick the saddle. Come in here out of sight; I'm going to
      take 'em off your trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, he led, half carried Vic, into a thicket of shrubs with a
      small open space at the center. The black and the wolf-dog followed and
      now the stranger pulled at the bridle rein. The stallion kneeled like a
      trained dog, and lying thus the shrubbery was high enough to hide him.
      Closer, sweeping through the wood, Vic heard the crash of the pursuit, yet
      the other was maddeningly slow of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay here, partner, and sit over there. I'm borrowin' your gun&rdquo;&mdash;a
      swift hand appropriated it from Vic's holster and his own fingers were too
      paralyzed to resist&mdash;&ldquo;and don't you try to ride my hoss unless you
      want them teeth in your throat. Lie quiet and tie up your hurt. Bart,
      watch him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there sat Gregg where he had slipped down in his daze of weakness with
      the great dog crouched at his feet and snarling ominously every time he
      raised his hand. The voices came closer; the crashing burst on his very
      ears, and now, through the interstices of the shrubbery he saw the
      stranger swing into the saddle on Grey Molly and urge her to a gallop. He
      could follow them for only an instant with his eyes, but it seemed to Vic
      that Molly cantered under her new rider with strange ease and lightness.
      It was partly the rest, no doubt, and partly the smaller burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep beat of racing hoofs, and then the dusty roan shot out of the trees
      close by with the sheriff leaning forward, jockeying his horse. It seemed
      that no living thing could escape from that relentless rider. Then right
      behind Vic a horse snorted and grunted&mdash;as it leaped a fallen log,
      perhaps&mdash;and he watched in alarm to see if the stallion would answer
      that sound with start or whinney. The black lay perfectly still, and
      instead of lifting up to answer or to look, the head lowered with ears
      flat back until the long, outstretched neck gave the animal a snaky
      appearance. The dog, too, though it showed murderous fangs whenever Vic
      moved, did not stir from his place, but lay flattening into the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut to the right! Cut to the right, Harry!&rdquo; came the voice of the
      sheriff, already piping from the distance as the last of the posse brushed
      out from the trees. &ldquo;Yo hoi! Gus, take the left arroyo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two answering yells, and then the rush of hoofs fell away. They were
      cornering the stranger, no doubt, and Vic struggled to lift himself to his
      feet and watch until a faint sound from the dog made him look down. Bart
      lay with his haunches drawn up under him, his forepaws digging into the
      soft loam, his eyes demoniac. Instinctively Vic reached for his absent
      gun, and then, despairing, relaxed to his former position. The wolf-dog
      lowered his head to his paws and there remained with the eyes following
      each intake of Gregg's breath. A rattle of gunshots flung back loosely
      from the hills, and among them Vic winced at the sound of the sheriff's
      rifle, clear and ringing over the bark of the revolvers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had they nailed the stranger? The firing recommenced, more faintly and
      prolonged, so that it was plain the posse maintained a running fusilade
      after the fugitive. After that fear of his own growing weakness shut out
      all else from the mind of Gregg as he felt his senses, his physical
      strength, flowing out like an ebb tide to a sea which, he knew, was death.
      He began to work desperately to bind up the wound and stop the flow of
      blood and it was fear which gave him momentary strength to tear away his
      shirt and then with his teeth and left hand rip it into strips. After
      that, heedless of the pain, he constructed a rude bandage, very clumsily,
      for he had to work over his shoulder. Here his teeth, once more, were
      almost as useful as another hand, and as the bandage grew tight the
      deadly, warm trickle along his side lessened and his fingers fell away
      from the last knot. He fainted.

      Chapter VII. Joan Disobeys
    </h2>
    <p>
      What he next knew was a fire of agony that wrapped his whole body and
      consciousness flashed back on him. Strong arms lifted him up, up; above
      him he sensed the eyes of his torturer, dim in moonlight, and he beat his
      clubbed left fist into that face. After that he knew he was being dragged
      onto a saddle, but a wave of pain rushed up his side and numbed his brain.
      Thereafter his senses returned by fits and starts, vaguely. Once he felt a
      steel cable that girdled his waist and breast and held him erect, though
      his head flopped back and forth; once his eyes opened and above him
      glittered the bright field of stars towards which he drifted through
      space, a mind without a body; once a stab of torment wakened him enough to
      hear: &ldquo;Easy Satan; watch them stones. One more jolt like that will send
      him clear to&mdash;&rdquo; And the voice glided into an eternity of distance.
      Yet again he swung tip from the pit of darkness and became aware of golden
      hair around a woman's face, and a marvelous soft, cool hand upon his
      forehead. Her voice reached him, too, and made him think of all things
      musical, all things distant, like the sounds of birds falling from the sky
      and though he understood not a syllable, a sweet assurance of safety
      flooded through him. He slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he woke again, it was from a dream of fleeing through empty air
      swifter than the wind with a wolf-dog looming behind him out of space, but
      presently he found that he was lying in a bed with a stream of sunlight
      washing across a white coverlet. A door at his right swung open and there
      in the entrance stood the wolf-dog of his vision with a five-year-old girl
      upon its back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go in there, Bart!&rdquo; whispered the child. &ldquo;Go on back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took one of those pointed wolf-ears in her chubby fist and tugged to
      swing him around, but Bart, with a speed which the eye could not follow,
      twisted his head and the rows of great teeth closed over her hand. It was
      so horrible that the cry froze in the throat of Gregg, yet the child, with
      only a little murmur of anger, reached over with her other hand and caught
      the wolf by the nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad Bart!&rdquo; she whispered, and raised the hand which he instantly
      released. White marks showed on the pudgy tan. &ldquo;Bad dog!&rdquo; she repeated,
      and beat his neck with an impotent little fist. The wolf-dog cringed, and
      turned from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; invited Gregg. He was surprised to find his voice thin, apt to
      swing up to a high pitch beyond his control. A shower of golden curls
      tossed away from her face as she looked to him. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, still
      with a guarded voice. She leaned far over, one hand buried in the ruff of
      Bart's neck to secure her balance, and with the other she laid hold of his
      right ear and drew him around facing the door once more. This time he
      showed his teeth but submitted, only twitching the ear back and forth a
      time or two when she relaxed her hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; repeated Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      She canted her head to one side and considered him with fearless blue
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to,&rdquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can't you, honey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner says no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He attempted to turn further towards her, but the pain in his right
      shoulder prevented. He found that his arm was bandaged to the elbow and
      held close to his side by a complex swathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your mother?&rdquo; asked Vic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner?&rdquo; she repeated, frowning in wonder. &ldquo;Why, munner is&mdash;my
      munner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; smiled he, &ldquo;and who's your pa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's your father? Who's your dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Dan. You ask a lot of things,&rdquo; she added, disapprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on in,&rdquo; pleaded Vic Gregg, &ldquo;and I won't ask nothin' more about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner says no,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She employed the moment of indecision by plucking at the hair of Bart's
      shoulders; he growled softly, terribly, but she paid not the slightest
      heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother won't care,&rdquo; asserted Vic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she nodded, &ldquo;but Daddy will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spanking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked blankly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will he do, then, if you come in to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll look at me.&rdquo; She grew breathless at the thought, and cast a guilty
      glance over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honey,&rdquo; chuckled Gregg, weakly, &ldquo;I'll take all the blame. Just you come
      along in and he'll do his lookin' at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought of the slender fellow who had rescued him and his large, gentle
      brown eyes, but to a child even those mild eyes might seem terrible with
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, true?&rdquo; said the child, wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest and true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; She made up her mind instantly, her face shining with
      excitement. &ldquo;Giddap, Bart.&rdquo; And she thumped the wolf-dog vigorously with
      her heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried her in with a few gliding steps, soundless, except for the
      light rattle of claws on the floor, but he stopped well out of reach of
      the bed and when Vic held his left hand as far as he could across his
      chest, Bart winced and gave harsh warning. Vic had seen vicious dogs in
      his day, seen them fighting, seen them playing, but he had never heard one
      of them growl like this. The upper lips of the animal twitched dangerously
      back and the sound came from the very depths of his body. It made the
      flesh crawl along Vic's back; one rip of those great teeth could tear a
      man's throat open. The child thudded her heels against the ribs of Bart
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giddap!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wolf-dog shuddered but would not budge an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naughty Bart!&rdquo; She slipped off to the floor. &ldquo;I'll make him come,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's the same to you,&rdquo; said Vic, rather hastily, &ldquo;I'd just as soon he
      stayed where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got to do what I want,&rdquo; she answered. She shook a tiny forefinger at
      him. &ldquo;Bart, you just come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog turned his blazing eyes on her and replied with a growl that shook
      his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she ordered, and struck him sharply on the nose. He blinked and
      lowered his head under the blow, but though the snarling stopped his teeth
      flashed. She caught him by both jowls and tugged him forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him be!&rdquo; urged Vic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got to come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And come he did, step by halting step, while she hauled him, and now the
      snarling hoarse intakes of breath filled the room. Once she moved a little
      to one side and Vic caught the glint of two eyes, red-stained, which were
      fixed undeviatingly upon her face. Mixed with Vic's alarm at the great
      fighting beast was a peculiar uneasiness, for there was something uncanny
      in the determination, the fearlessness of this infant. When she stepped
      away the wolf-dog stood trembling visibly but his eyes were still not upon
      the man he hated or feared to approach but upon the child's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you pat him now?&rdquo; she asked, not for an instant turning to Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but it's close enough,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I don't want him any
      closer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got to come.&rdquo; She stamped. &ldquo;Bart, you come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flinched forward, an inch. &ldquo;Bart!&rdquo; Her hands were clenched and her
      little body quivered with resolution; the snake-like head came to the very
      edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now pat him!&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      By very unpleasant degrees, Vic stretched his hand towards that growling
      menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll take my arm off,&rdquo; he complained. Shame kept him from utterly
      refusing the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't bite you one bit,&rdquo; declared the child. &ldquo;But I'll hold his nose
      if you're afraid.&rdquo; And instantly she clasped the pointed muzzle between
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when Vic's hand hovered above his head Bart had no eye for him, could
      not divert his gaze from the face of the child. Once, twice and again,
      delicately as one might handle bubbles, Gregg touched that scarred
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made him come, didn't I?&rdquo; she cried in triumph, and turned a tense
      little face towards Vic, but the instant her eyes moved the wolf-dog
      leaped away half the width of the room, and stood shivering, more devilish
      than ever. She stamped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad, bad, bad Bart,&rdquo; she said angrily. &ldquo;Shall I make him come again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him be,&rdquo; muttered Vic, closing his eyes. &ldquo;Leave him be where he is.
      I don't want him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it's hard to make him do things, sometimes. But Daddy Dan
      can make him do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Vic. He was remembering how, at the master's order, Bart
      had crouched at his feet in the wood, an unchained murderer hungrily
      waiting for an excuse to kill. There was something very odd about the
      people of this house; and it would be a long time before he rid himself of
      the impression of the cold, steady eyes which had flashed up to him a
      moment before out of that baby face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; called a voice from beyond, and the soft fiber of it made Vic
      certain that it belonged to the rider of the black stallion. The little
      girl ran a step towards the door, and then stopped and shrank back against
      the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're afraid your Dad'll find you here,&rdquo; said Vic, &ldquo;just you run
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was nervously twisting her hands in her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Dan'll know,&rdquo; she whispered without turning. &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;he
      won't let me be afraid&mdash;-even of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A small hand slipped up, fumbled a bit, found the thumb of Vic Gregg, and
      closed softly over it. With this to steady her, she waited, facing the
      door.

    <h2>
      Chapter VIII. Discipline
    </h2>
    <p>
      A light step crossed the outer room, with something peculiar in its
      lightness, as if the heel were not touching the floor, with the effect of
      the padded fall of the feet of some great cat; there was both softness and
      the sense of weight. First the wolf-dog pricked his ears and turned
      towards the door, the pudgy fist closed convulsively over Vic's thumb, and
      then his rescuer stood in the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, partner,&rdquo; called Vic. &ldquo;I got company, you see. The door blew open
      and I asked your little girl in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you not to come here,&rdquo; said the other. Vic felt the child tremble,
      but there was no burst of excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't want to come,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;But I kep' on askin' her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The emotionless eye of &ldquo;Daddy Dan&rdquo; held upon Joan. &ldquo;I told you not to
      come,&rdquo; he said. Joan swallowed in mute agony, and the wolf-dog slipped to
      the side of the master and licked his hand as though in dumb intercession.
      The blood ran coldly in the veins of Gregg, as if he saw a fist raised to
      strike the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went swiftly, at that, sidled past her father with her eyes lifted,
      fascinated, and so out the door where she paused an instant to flash back
      a wistful appeal. Nothing but silence, and then her feet pattering off
      into the outer room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you better go keep her company, Bart,&rdquo; said the father, and at this
      sign of relenting Vic felt his tensed muscles relaxing; the wolf whined
      softly and glided through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feeling better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a hoss off green feed. I been lyin' here drinkin' up the sunshine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other stood beside the open window and there he canted his head, his
      glance far off and intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'you hear?&rdquo; he asked, turning sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fierce eagerness in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's spring,&rdquo; he murmured, without answering more directly than this, and
      Vic felt that the other had changed again, grown understandable.
      Nevertheless, the shock of that sudden alteration at the window kept him
      watching his host with breathless interest. Whatever it was that the
      strange fellow heard, a light had gleamed in his eyes for a moment. As he
      sauntered back towards the bed just a trace of it lingered about him, a
      hint of sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spring?&rdquo; answered Gregg. &ldquo;Yep, I smelled spring a few days back and I
      started out to find some action. You can see for yourself that I found it,
      partner.&rdquo; He stirred, uneasily, but it was necessary that the story should
      be told lest it reach the ears of this man from another source. It was one
      thing to shelter a fugitive from justice whose crime was unknown, perhaps
      trifling, but it might be quite another story if this gentle, singular man
      learned that his guest was a new-made murderer. Better that he should
      learn the tale now and form his prejudices in favor of Gregg. &ldquo;I'll tell
      you the whole story,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave the story be,&rdquo; he said, and there was something in the quiet
      firmness of his manner which made it impossible for Vic to continue.
      &ldquo;You're here and you're hurt and you need a pile of rest. That's about
      enough story for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vic put himself swiftly in the place of the other. Suppose that he and
      Betty Neal should have a cabin off in the mountains like this, how would
      they receive a wounded fugitive from justice? As unquestioningly as this?
      In a surge of gratitude he looked mistily towards his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you're white. Damned white. That's all. My name's
      Vic Gregg and I come from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; cut in the other. &ldquo;I'm glad to know your name but in case
      anybody might be askin' me I wouldn't care to know where you come from.&rdquo;
       He smiled. &ldquo;I'm Dan Barry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had to be a left-handed shake on the part of Vic, a thing of which he
      often thought in the days that followed, but now he sent his memory
      hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems like I've heard your name before,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I dunno where.
      Were you ever around Alder, Barry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; His manner suggested that the topic might as well be closed. He
      reached over and dropped his hand lightly on the forehead of Vic. A
      tingling current flowed from it into the brain of the wounded man. &ldquo;Your
      blood's still a bit hot,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Lie quiet and don't even think.
      You're safe here. They ain't a thing goin' to get at you. Not a thing.
      You'll stay till you get ready to leave. S'long. I'll see that you get
      something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out with that unusual, padding step which Vic had noticed before
      and closed the door softly behind him. In spite of that barrier Gregg
      could hear the noises from the next room quite clearly, as some one
      brought in wood and dropped it on a stone hearth, rattling. He fell into a
      pleasant doze, just stretching his body now and then to enjoy the coolness
      of the sheets, the delicious sense of being cared for and the returning
      strength in his muscles. Through that haze he heard voices, presently,
      which called him back to wakefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ought to be good for him. Take it in, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall. Dan, what has Joan done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went in there. I told her to leave him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she says he asked her to come in&mdash;said he would take the blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her not to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor baby! She's outside, now, weeping her eyes out on Bart's shoulder
      and he's trying to comfort her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was purer English than Vic was accustomed to hear even from his
      schoolmistress, but more than the words, the voice surprised him, the low,
      controlled voice of a woman of gentle blood. He turned his head and looked
      out the window, baffled. Far above, shooting out of sight, went the slope
      of a mountain, a cliff shining in the slant sun of the afternoon here, a
      tumbled slide of rocks and debris there, and over the shoulder of this
      mountain he saw white-headed monsters stepping back in range beyond range.
      Why should a girl of refinement choose the isolation of such a place as
      this for her home? It was not the only strange thing about this household,
      however, and he would dismiss conjectures until he was once more on his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was saying: &ldquo;Won't you speak to her now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little pause. Then: &ldquo;No, not until evenin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little exclamation of unhappiness and then the door moved open; Vic
      found himself looking up to the face with the golden hair which he
      remembered out of his nightmare. She nodded to him cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so happy that you're better,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dan says that the fever is
      nearly gone.&rdquo; She rested a large tray she carried on the foot of the bed
      and Vic discovered, to his great content, that it was not hard to meet her
      eyes. Usually girls embarrassed him, but he recognized so much of Joan in
      the features of the mother that he felt well acquainted at once.
      Motherhood, surely, sat as lightly on her shoulders as fatherhood did on
      Dan Barry, yet he felt a great pity as he looked at her, this flowerlike
      beauty lost in the rocks and snow with only one man near her. She was like
      music played without an audience except senseless things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep, I'm a lot better,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but it sure makes me terrible
      sorry, ma'am, that I got your little girl in trouble. Mostly, it was my
      fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waved away all need of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think an instant about that, Mr. Gregg. Joan needs a great deal of
      disciplining.&rdquo; She laughed a little. &ldquo;She has so much of her father in
      her, you see. Now, are you strong enough to lift yourself higher in the
      pillows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They managed it between them, for he was weaker than he thought and when
      he was padded into position with cushions she laid the tray across his
      knees. His head swam at sight of it. Forty-eight hours of fasting had
      sharpened his appetite, and the loaded tray whetted a razor edge, for a
      great bowl of broth steamed forth an exquisite fragrance on one side and
      beside it she lifted a napkin to let him peek at a slice of venison steak.
      Then there was butter, yellow as the gold for which he had been digging
      all winter, and real cream for his coffee&mdash;a whole pitcher of it&mdash;and
      snowy bread. Best of all, she did not stay to embarrass him with her
      watching while he ate, since above all things in the world a hungry man
      hates observation when the board is spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, consuming sleep rippled over him from his feet to his eyes to
      his brain. He partially roused when the tray was removed, and the pillows
      slipped from under his back, but with a vague understanding that expert
      hands were setting the bed in order his senses fled once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours and hours later he opened his eyes in utter darkness with a thin,
      sweet voice still ringing in his ears. He could not place himself until he
      turned his head and saw a meager, broken, rectangular line of light which
      was the door, and immediately afterwards the voice cried: &ldquo;Oh, Daddy Dan!
      And what did the wolf do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm comin' to that, Joan, but don't you talk about wolves so loud or old
      Black Bart'll think you're talkin' about him. See him lookin' at you now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But please go on. I won't say one little word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man's voice began again, softly, so that not a word was audible to
      Gregg; he heard the crackle of burning logs upon the hearth; saw the
      rectangle of light flicker; caught a faint scent of wood smoke, and then
      he slept once more.

    <h2>
      Chapter IX. The Long Arm Of The Law
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the first the wound healed rapidly, for Vic's blood was perfectly
      pure, the mountain air a tonic which strengthened him, and his food and
      care of the best. The high-powered rifle bullet whipped cleanly through
      his shoulder, breaking no bone and tearing no ligament, and the flesh
      closed swiftly. Even Vic's mind carried no burden to oppress him in care
      for the future or regret for the past, for if he occasionally remembered
      the limp body of Hansen on the floor of Captain Lorrimer's saloon he could
      shrug the picture into oblivion. It had been fair fight, man to man, with
      all the odds in favor of Blondy, who had been allowed to pull his gun
      first. If Vic thought about the future at all, it was with a blind
      confidence that some time and in some unrevealed way he would get back to
      Alder and marry Betty Neal. In the meantime, as the days of the spring
      went mildly by, he was up and about and very soon there was only a little
      stiffness in his right arm to remind him of Pete Glass and the dusty roan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent most of his time close to the cabin, for though he had forgotten
      the world there was no decisive proof that the world would forget him half
      so easily; that was not the way of the sheriff. He had been known to spend
      years in the hunt for a single misdoer and Vic had no care to wander out
      where he might be seen. Besides, it was very pleasant about the cabin. The
      house itself was built solidly, roomily, out of logs hewn on the timbered
      slopes above and dragged down to this little plateau. Three mountains, to
      the north, south and west, rolled back and up, cutting away the sunlight
      in the early afternoon, but at this point the quick slopes put out
      shoulders and made, among them, a comfortable bit of rolling ground, deep
      soiled and fertile. Here, so Kate Barry assured him, the wild flowers came
      even earlier than they did in the valley so far below them, and to be sure
      when Vic first walked from the house he found the meadow aflame with color
      except for the space covered by the truck-garden and the corral. In that
      enclosure he found Grey Molly fenced away from the black with several
      other horses of commoner blood, for the stallion, he learned, recognized
      no fraternity of horseflesh, but killed what he could reach. Grey Molly
      was quite recovered from her long run, and she greeted him in her familiar
      way, with ears flattened viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have stayed on here quite happily for any space of time, but more
      and more Vic felt that he was an intruder; he sensed it, rather than
      received a hint of word or eye. In the first place the three were complete
      in themselves, a triangle of happiness without need of another member for
      variety or interest. It was plain at a glance that the girl was
      whole-heartedly happy, and whatever incongruity lay between her and these
      rough mountains he began to understand that her love for Barry and the
      child made ample amends. As for the other two, he always thought of them
      in the same instant, for if the child had her eyes and her hair from her
      mother, she had her nature from the man. They were together constantly, on
      walks up the mountain, when she rode Black Bart up the steep places: on
      dips into the valley, when he carried her before him on the stallion. She
      had the same soft voice, the same quick, furtive ways, the same soundless
      laughter, at times; and when Barry sat in the evening, as he often did for
      hours, staring at empty air, she would climb on his knee, place his
      unresisting arm around her, and she looking up into his face, sharing his
      silences. Sometimes Vic wondered if the young mother were not troubled,
      made a little jealous by this perfect companionship, but he never found a
      trace of it. It was she, finally, who made him determine to leave as soon
      as his shoulder muscles moved with perfect freedom, for as the days
      slipped past he felt that she grew more and more uneasy, and her eyes had
      a way of going from him to her husband as though she believed their guest
      a constant danger to Barry. Indeed, to some small extent he was a danger,
      for the law might deal hardly with a man who took a fugitive out of the
      very grip of its hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a rather ironical chance, on the very morning when he decided that he
      must start his journey the next day but one, Vic learned that he must not
      linger even so long as that. Pete Glass and the law had not forgotten him,
      indeed, nearly so well as he had forgotten the law and Pete Glass, for as
      he sat in his room filling a pipe after breakfast the voice of Barry
      called him out, and he found his host among the rocks which rimmed the
      southern end of the plateau, in front of the house. To the north the
      ground fell away smoothly, rolled down to the side of the mountain, and
      then dipped easily to the valley&mdash;the only direction from which the
      cabin was accessible, though here the grade was possible for a buckboard.
      To the south the plateau ended in a drop that angled sharply down, almost
      a cliff in places, and from this point of vantage the eye carried nameless
      miles down the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are them friends of yours?&rdquo; asked Dan Barry, as he stood among those
      rocks. &ldquo;Take a long look.&rdquo; And he handed a strong pair of field glasses to
      Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter peered over the dizzy edge. Down there, in the very act of
      fording the river to get to their side of it, he marked five horsemen&mdash;no,
      six, for he almost missed the leader of the troop, a dusty figure which
      melted into the background. All the terror of the first flight rushed back
      on Vic. He stood palsied, not in fear of that posse but at the very
      thought of pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only one way,&rdquo; he stammered at length. &ldquo;I'll&mdash;Dan, give me a
      hand to get a saddle on Grey Molly and I'll laugh at 'em yet. Damn 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you goin' to do?&rdquo; It was the same unhurried voice which had spoken
      to Vic on the day of the rescue and it irritated him in the same manner
      now. Kate had come running from the house with her apron fluttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going down that slope to the north,&rdquo; said Vic, &ldquo;and I'll get by 'em
      hell-bent-for-election. Once I show my heels to that lot they're done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He talked as much to restore his courage as from, confidence, for if the
      posse sighted him going down that slope on the gray it would take a
      super-horseman and a super-horse to escape before they closed the gap.
      Barry considered the situation with a new gleam in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; he said, as Vic started towards the corral. &ldquo;That way you
      got planned is a good way&mdash;to die. You listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here Kate broke in on them. &ldquo;Dan, what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to take the gray and go down the slope. I'm going to lead 'em
      off Vic's trail,&rdquo; said Barry quietly, but it seemed to Vic that he avoided
      his wife's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Betty Neal, Vic knew, would have risen shrill at a time like
      this. Kate spoke even more low than usual, but there was a thing in her
      voice that struck a tremor through Gregg. &ldquo;If it's death for him, what is
      it for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all. If they see me and head for me before the way's clear,
      I'll let 'em come up and see they have the wrong man. If I get the chance,
      I'll lead 'em away. And Vic, you'll hit between those two mountains&mdash;see
      'em?&mdash;and cut across country. No hoss could carry you there, except
      Satan, and you couldn't ride him. You'll have to go on foot but they'll
      never look for you on that side. When you get to the easygoin', down in
      the valley, buy a hoss and hit for the railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate turned on Vic, trembling. &ldquo;Are you going to let him do it?&rdquo; she
      asked. &ldquo;Are you going to let him do it, again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had seen a certain promise of escape held before him the moment before,
      but pride made him throw that certainty away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in a million years,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll do what I say, and you'll start now. I got a better idea than
      that. If you head just over the side of that north mountain you'll find a
      path that a hoss can follow. It won't take you clear away from them down
      below, but there ain't a chance in ten that they'll come that way. Take my
      old brown hoss with the white face. He'll carry you safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vic hesitated. The fierce eyes of Kate were on him and with all his soul
      he wanted to play the man, but liberty was sweet, sweeter than ever to
      Vic. She seemed to give him up as he stood there with his heart, in his
      throat; she turned back to Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not touched him, but he made a vague gesture as though brushing
      away a restraining hand. She cried: &ldquo;If you come close to them&mdash;if,
      they start shooting&mdash;you might want to fight back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shot before,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I didn't fire once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the second time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, there would be danger in it, but as Barry himself had said, if
      the way was closed to him he could surrender to them, and they could not
      harm him. Vic tried in vain to understand this overmastering terror in the
      girl, for she seemed more afraid of what Dan might do to the posse than
      what the posse might do to Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ain't a day for fightin',&rdquo; said Dan, and he waved towards the
      mountains. It was one of those misty spring days when the sun raises a
      vapor from the earth and the clouds blow low around the upper peaks; every
      ravine was poured full of blue shadow, and even high up the slopes, where
      patches of snow had melted, grass glimmered, a tender green among the
      white. &ldquo;This ain't a day for fighting,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shrill, quavering neigh, like the whinney of a galloping horse, rang
      from beyond the house, and Vic saw the black stallion racing up and down
      his corral. Back and forth he wove, then raced straight for the bars,
      flashed above them, and stood free beyond, with the sunshine trembling on
      him. He seemed to pause, wondering what to do with his new freedom, then
      he came at a loose gallop for the master. Not Satan alone, for now Black
      Bart slid across the plateau like a shadow, weaving among the boulders,
      and came straight towards Barry. Vic himself felt a change, a sort of
      uneasy happiness; he breathed it with the air. The very sunlight was
      electric. He saw Kate run close to Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go this time, you'll never come back, Dan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black stallion swung up beside them, and as he halted his hoofs
      knocked a rattling spray of pebbles ahead. On the other side of the woman
      and the man the wolf-dog ran uneasily here and there, trying to watch the
      face of the master which Kate obscured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't goin' far. I just want to get a hoss runnin' under me enough to
      cut a wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even Satan and Bart feel what I feel. They came without being called.
      They never do that unless there's danger ahead. What can I do to convince
      you? Dan, you'll drive me mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, and if the girl wished him to stay now seemed the time
      for persuasion; but she gave up the argument suddenly. She turned away,
      and Vic saw in her face the same desperate, helpless look as that of a boy
      who cannot swim, beyond his depth in the river. There was no sign of
      tears; they might come afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had come over them? This desperation in Kate, this touch of anxiety
      in the very horse and the wolf-dog? Vic forgot his own danger while he
      stared and it seemed to him that the spark of change had come from Barry.
      There was something in his eyes which Vic found hard to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment you came I knew you brought bad luck with you!&rdquo; cried Kate.
      &ldquo;He brought you in bleeding. He saved you and came in with blood on his
      hands and I guessed at the end. Oh, I wish you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo; broke in Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped upon one of the stones and buried her face in her hands and
      Dan paid no more attention to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They're across the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Vic gave up the struggle, for the tears of Kate made him think of
      Betty Neal and he followed Dan towards the corral. Around them the
      stallion ran like a hunting dog eager to be off.

    <h2>
      Chapter X. One Trail Ends
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can trust Grey Molly to me, Vic,&rdquo; said Dan, standing at the head of
      the gray mare. &ldquo;I'll keep her as safe as if she was Satan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregg watched her almost sadly. He had always taken a rather childish
      pride in her fierceness. She knew him as a dog knows its master and he had
      always been the only one who could handle her readily in the saddle. But
      one who knew nothing of horses and their ways could see the entente which
      had been instantly established between Barry and Grey Molly. When he spoke
      her ears pricked. When he raised his hand she stretched her nose
      inquisitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no pitch in her when Barry swung into the saddle and that was a
      thing without precedent in Molly's history. She tried none of her usual
      catlike side-steps and throwing of the head. Altogether, Vic was troubled
      even as he would have been at the sight of Betty Neal in the arms of
      another man. It was desertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know what you've done for me and I know what you're
      doin' now.&rdquo; He took the slender hand of the other in his big paw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the time comes when I can pay you back, so help me God&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oaths don't do no good,&rdquo; cut in Barry without a trace of emotion. He
      added frankly: &ldquo;It ain't altogether for your sake. Those gents down there
      have played tag once with me and now I'd like to play with them. Molly's
      fresh today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was already looking over his shoulder while he spoke; as if his mind
      were even then at work upon the posse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'long, partner. Good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they parted and Vic, jogging slowly up the steep path, saw Grey Molly
      wheeled and sent at a sweeping gallop over the meadow. His heart leaped
      jealously and the next moment went out in a flood of gratitude,
      admiration, as Barry swung off the shoulder of the mountain, waved his hat
      towards Kate, and dipped at once out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shelving ground along which Barry rode sometimes was a broad surface
      like a spacious, graded road; again it shelved away and opened a view of
      all the valley. When he reached the first of these places the rider looked
      back and down and saw the posse skirting rapidly on his side of the river,
      behind him and close to the cliff. They rode at an easy lope, and he could
      see that their heads were bent to watch the ground. Even at this casual
      gait they would reach the point at which he and the gray must swing onto
      the floor of the valley before him unless he urged Molly to top speed. He
      must get there at a sufficient distance from them to escape close rifle
      fire, and certainly beyond point-blank revolver range. Accordingly he
      threw his weight more into the stirrups and over the withers of the mare.
      This brought greater poundage on her forehand and made her apt to stumble
      or actually miss her step, but it increased her running power.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no need of a touch of the spurs. The gathering of the reins
      seemed to tell Molly everything. One ear flickered back, then she leaped
      out at full speed. It was as though the mind of the man had sent an
      electric current down the reins and told her his thought. Now she
      floundered at her foot, struck a loose stone, now she veered sharply and
      wide to escape a boulder, now she cleared a gulley with a long leap, and
      riding high as he was, bent forward out of balance to escape observation
      from below. It was only a miracle of horsemanship that kept her from
      breaking her neck as they lurched down the pitch. Grey Molly seemed to be
      carrying no weight, only a clinging intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this speed he was sure to reach the valley safely in front unless the
      posse caught sight of him on the way and gave chase, and Barry counted on
      that instinct in hunting men which makes them keep their eyes low&mdash;the
      same sense which leads a searcher to look first under the bed and last of
      all at the wall and ceiling. Once more, as he neared his goal, he looked
      back and down, and there came the six horsemen, their quirts swinging,
      their hat-brims blown straight up they raced at full speed. They had seen
      the gray and they rode for blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outstretched neck of Grey Molly, her flattened ears, the rapid clangor
      of her hoofs on the rocks, seemed to indicate that she already was doing
      her uttermost, but after the glimpse of the pursuit, Barry crouched a
      little lower, his hand gathering the reins just behind her head, his voice
      was near her, speaking softly, quickly. She responded with a snort of
      effort, as though she realized the danger and willingly accepted it. One
      ear, as she rushed down the slope, was pricked and one flagged back to the
      guiding, strengthening voice of the rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path wound in leisurely curves now, but there was a straight cut down
      a slide of gravel, a dangerous slope even in firm ground, a terrible angle
      with those loose pebbles underfoot. Yet this was a time for chance-taking.
      Already the dusty man on the roan rode with his revolver balanced for the
      snap shot. The next instant his gun swung down, he actually reined up in
      astonishment. The fugitive had flung himself far back against the cantle
      and sent Grey Molly at the slide. It was not a matter of running as the
      mare shot over the brink. Molly sat back on her haunches, braced her
      forelegs, and went down like an avalanche. Over the rush and roar of the
      pebbles, over the yell of wonder from the pursuers, she heard the voice of
      her rider, a clear and steady voice, and the tautened reins telegraphed to
      her bewildered mind the wish of the man. She struck the level with
      stunning force, toppled, nearly fell, and then straightened along her
      course in a staggering gallop. Started from its nice balance by the rush
      of stones they loosened, a ten-ton rock came toppling after, leaped up
      from the valley floor like a live thing, and then thundered away towards
      the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grey Molly, finding her legs once more, tried the level going. She had
      beaten the same horses before under the crushing impost of Gregg's weight.
      With this lighter rider who clung like a part of her, who gave perfectly
      to the rhythm of her gallop, she fairly walked away from the posse. Once,
      twice and again the gun spoke from the hand of Pete Glass, but it was the
      taking of a long last chance rather than a sign of closing on his chase.
      In ten minutes Grey Molly dipped out of sight among the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first hour Barry could have cut away across country with little
      fear of discovery from the sheriff, but he was in no hurry to escape.
      Sometimes he dismounted and looked to his cinches and talked to the horse.
      Grey Molly listened with pricking ears and often canted her head to one
      side as though she strove to understand the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new and singular pleasure to Barry. He was accustomed to the
      exhaustless, elastic strength of Satan, with the cunning brain of a beast
      of prey and the speed of an antelope. On the black horse he could have
      ridden circles around that posse all day. But Grey Molly was a different
      problem. She was not a force to be simply directed and controlled. She was
      something to be helped. Her very weakness, compared with the stallion,
      appealed to him. And it was a thrilling pleasure to feel his power over
      her grow until she, also, seemed to have entered the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      A game it was, as he had said to Vic when they parted, with the rather
      essential difference that in this pastime one was tagged with a forty-five
      caliber chunk of lead and was quite apt to remain &ldquo;it&rdquo; for the remainder
      of eternity. Barry dropped further and further back towards the posse. The
      danger fascinated him. Once he whistled high and shrill as a hawk's scream
      from the top of a bluff while the posse labored through a ravine below. He
      saw the guns flash out, and waited. He heard the sing of the bullets
      around him, and the splashing lead on a solid-rock face just beneath him;
      he listened till the deep echoes spoke from the gulch, then waved his hat
      and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was almost defeating the purpose of his play for if he came that
      close again they would probably make out that they were following a decoy.
      Accordingly, since he had now drawn them well away from Vic's line of
      escape, he turned his back reluctantly on the posse and struck across the
      hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept on for the better part of an hour before he doubled and swung in a
      wide circle towards his cabin. He had laid out a course which the wise
      sheriff could follow until dark and be none the wiser; and if Pete Glass
      were the finest trailer who ever studied sign and would never be able to
      read the tokens of the return ride. Accordingly, with all this well in
      mind, he brought Grey Molly to a full halt and gazed around, utterly
      stunned by surprise, when, half way up the valley, a rifle spoke small but
      sharp from one side, and a bullet clipped the rocks not the length of the
      horse away. He understood. When he cut straightaway across the country he
      had indeed left a baffling trail, a trail so dim, in fact, that Pete Glass
      had wisely given it up and taken the long chance by cutting back to the
      point at which the hunt began. So their paths crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barry spoke sharply to the mare and loosed the reins, but she started into
      a full gallop too late. There came a brief hum, a thudding blow, and Grey
      Molly pitched forward.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XI. A New Trail Begins
    </h2>
    <p>
      If he had been an ordinary rider, sitting heavily far back in the saddle,
      at the end of a long ride, Barry would either have been flung clear and
      smashed horribly against the rocks, or, more likely, he would have been
      entangled in the stirrups and crushed to death instantly by the weight of
      his horse; but he rode always lightly poised and when the mare pitched
      forward his feet were already clear of the stirrups. He landed, catlike,
      on hands and feet, unhurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a long shot, a lucky hit even for a marksman of the sheriff's
      caliber, and now the six horsemen streamed over a distant hilltop and
      swept into the valley to take their quarry dead, or half dead, from his
      fall. However, that approaching danger was nothing in the eye of Barry. He
      ran to the fallen mare and caught her head in his arms. She ceased her
      struggles to rise as soon as he touched her and whinneyed softly. The left
      foreleg lay twisted horribly beneath her, broken. Grey Molly had run her
      last race, and as Barry kneeled, holding the brave head close to him, he
      groaned, and looked away from her eyes. It was only an instant of
      weakness, and when he turned to her again he was drawing his gun from its
      holster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beating hoofs of the posse as they raced towards him made a growing
      murmur through the clear air. Barry glanced towards them with a consummate
      loathing. They had killed a horse to stop a man, and to him it was more
      than murder. What harm had she done them except to carry her rider bravely
      and well? The tears of rage and sorrow which a child sheds welled into the
      eyes of Dan Barry. Every one of them had a hand in this horrible killing;
      was, to that half animal and half-childish nature, a murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chin was on his shoulder; the quiver of pain in her nostrils ended as
      he spoke; and while the fingers of his left hand trailed caressingly
      across her forehead, his right carried the muzzle to her temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave Molly, good girl,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;they'll pay for you a death for a
      death and a man for a hoss.&rdquo; The yellow which had glinted in his eyes
      during the run was afire now. &ldquo;It ain't far; only a step to go; and then
      you'll be where they ain't any saddles, nor any spurs to gall you, Molly,
      but just pastures that's green all year, and nothin' to do but loaf in the
      sun and smell the wind. Here's good luck to you, girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His gun spoke sharp and short and he laid the limp head reverently on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had all happened in very few seconds, and the posse was riding through
      the river, still a long shot off, when Barry drew his rifle from its case
      on the saddle. Moreover, the failing light which had made the sheriff's
      hit so much a matter of luck was now still dimmer, yet Barry snapped his
      gun to the shoulder and fired the instant the butt lay in the grove. For
      another moment nothing changed in the appearance of the riders, then a man
      leaned out of his saddle and fell full length in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around him his companions floundered, lifted and placed him on the bank,
      and then threw themselves from their horses to take shelter behind the
      first rocks they could find; they had no wish to take chances with a man
      who could snap-shoot like this in such a light, at such a distance. By the
      time they were in position their quarry had slipped out of sight and they
      had only the blackening boulders for targets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God amighty,&rdquo; cried Ronicky Joe, &ldquo;are you goin' to let that murderin'
      hound-dog get clear off, Pete? Boys, who's with me for a run at him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For it was Harry Fisher who had fallen and lay now on the wet bank with
      his arms flung wide and a red spot rimmed with purple in the center of his
      forehead; and Fisher was Ronicky Joe's partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lay where you are,&rdquo; commanded the sheriff, and indeed there had been
      no rousing response to Ronicky Joe's appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You yaller quitters,&rdquo; groaned Joe. &ldquo;Give me a square chance and I'll
      tackle Vic Gregg alone day or night, on hoss or on foot. Are we five goin'
      to lay down to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that was Vic Gregg,&rdquo; answered the sheriff, slipping over the insult
      with perfect calm, &ldquo;I wouldn't of told you to scatter for cover; but that
      ain't Vic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete, what in hell are you drivin' at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it ain't Vic,&rdquo; said the sheriff. &ldquo;Vic is a good man with a hoss and
      a good man with a gun, but he couldn't never ride like the gent over there
      in the rocks, and he couldn't shoot like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed, in confirmation, at the body of Harry Fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can rush that hill if you want, but speakin' personal, I ain't ready
      to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thoughtful silence held the others until Sliver Waldron broke it with
      his deep bass. &ldquo;You ain't far off, Pete. I done some thinkin' along them
      lines when I seen him standin' up there over the arroyo wavin' his hat at
      the bullets. Vic didn't never have the guts for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the lower valley was gray, dark in comparison with the bright peaks
      above it, before the sheriff rose from his place and led the posse towards
      the body of Grey Molly. There they found as much confirmation of Pete's
      theory as they needed, for Vic's silver-mounted saddle was known to all of
      them, and this was a plain affair which they found on the dead horse.
      Waldron pushed back his hat to scratch his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at them eyes, boys,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Molly has been beatin' us all
      day and she looks like she's fightin' us still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff was not a man of very many words, and surely of little
      sentiment; perhaps it was the heat of the long chase which now made him
      take off his hat so that the air could reach his sweaty forehead. &ldquo;Gents,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;she lived game and she died game. But they ain't no use of
      wastin' that saddle. Take it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was Grey Molly's epitaph.
    </p>
    <p>
      They decided to head straight back for the nearest town with the body of
      Harry Fisher, and, fagged by the desperate riding of that day, they let
      their horses go with loose rein, at a walk. Darkness gathered; the last
      light faded from even the highest peaks; the last tinge of color dropped
      out of the sky as they climbed from the valley. Now and then one of the
      horses cleared its nostrils with a snort, but on the whole they went in
      perfect silence with the short grass silencing the hoofbeats, and never a
      word passed from man to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond doubt, if it had not been for that same silence, if it had not been
      for the slowness with which they drifted through the dark, what follows
      could never have happened. They had crossed a hill, and descended into a
      very narrow ravine which came to so sharp a point that the horses had to
      be strung out in single file. The ravine twisted to the right and then the
      last man of the procession heard the sheriff call: &ldquo;Halt, there! Up with
      your hands, or I'll drill you!&rdquo; When they swung from side to side, craning
      their heads to look, they made out a shadowy horseman facing Pete head on.
      Then the sheriff's voice again: &ldquo;Gregg, I'm considerable glad to meet up
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If that meeting had taken place in any other spot probably Gregg would
      have taken his chance on escaping through the night, but in this narrow
      pass he could swing to neither side and before he could turn the brown
      horse entirely around the sheriff might pump him full of lead. They
      gathered in a solemn quiet around him; the irons were already upon his
      wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you've got me, but you'll have to give in
      that you had all the luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment after that sharp command in the familiar, dreaded voice of Pete
      Glass, Vic had been glad that the lone flight was over. Eventually this
      was bound to come. He would go back and face the law, and three men lived
      to swear that Blondy had gone after his gun first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe luck,&rdquo; said the sheriff. &ldquo;How d' you come back this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made a plumb circle,&rdquo; chuckled Gregg. &ldquo;Rode like a fool not carin' where
      I hit out for, and the end of it was that it was dark before I'd had sense
      to watch where the sun went down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of cheerful, ain't you?&rdquo; cut in Ronicky Joe, and his voice was as
      dry as the crisping leaves in an autumn wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain't any call for me to wear crepe yet,&rdquo; answered Gregg. &ldquo;Worst
      fool thing I ever done was to cut and run for it. The old Captain will
      tell you gents that Blondy went for his gun first&mdash;had it clean out
      of the leather before I touched mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and the silence of those dark figures sank in upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got to warn you,&rdquo; said Pete Glass, &ldquo;that what you say now can be used
      again you later on before the jury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, boys,&rdquo; burst out Vic, &ldquo;d'you think I'm a plain, low-down,
      murderin' snake? Harry, ain't you got a word for me? Are you like the rest
      of 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No voice answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said Ronicky, &ldquo;why don't you speak to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a brutal thing to do, but Ronicky was never a gentle sort in his
      best moments; he scratched a match and held it so that under the
      spluttering light Gregg found himself staring into the face of Harry
      Fisher. And he could not turn his eyes away until the match burned down to
      Ronicky's finger tip and then dropped in a streak of red to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sheriff spoke cold and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partner,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the old days, maybe your line of talk would do
      some good, but not now. You picked that fight with Blondy. You knew you
      was faster on the draw and Hansen didn't have a chance. He was the worst
      shot in Alder and everybody in Alder knew it. You picked that fight and
      you killed your man, and you're goin' to hang for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another hush; no murmur of assent or dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they's one way out for you, Gregg, and I'm layin' it clear. We wanted
      you bad, and we got you; but they's another man we want a lot worse. A
      pile! Gregg, take me where I can find the gent what done for Harry Fisher
      and you'll never stand up in front of a jury. You got my word on that.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XII. The Crisis
    </h2>
    <p>
      Those mountains above the Barry cabin were, as he told Vic Gregg,
      inaccessible to men on horseback except by one path, yet there was a
      single class of travelers who roamed at will through far more difficult
      ground than this. Speaking in general, where a man can go a burro can go,
      and where a burro can go he usually manages to carry his pack. He crawls
      up a raged down-pitch of rocks that comes dangerously close to the
      perpendicular; he walks securely along a crumbling ledge with half his
      body over a thousand yards of emptiness. Therefore the prospectors with
      their burros have combed the worst mountains of the West and it was hardly
      a surprise to Kate Barry when she saw two men come down the steepest slope
      above the cabin with two little pack animals scrambling and sliding before
      them. It was still some time before nightfall, but the sun had dropped out
      of sight fully an hour ago and now the western mountains were blackening
      against a sky whose thin, clear blue grew yellow towards evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against that dark mass of the mountainside, she could not make out the two
      travelers clearly, so she shaded her eyes and peered up, high up. The
      slope was so sheer that if one of the four figures lost footing it would
      come crashing to her very feet. When they saw her and shouted down the
      sound fell as clearly as if they had called from the cabin, yet they had a
      good half hour's labor between that greeting and the moment they came out
      on the level before Kate. From the instant they called she remained in
      motionless, deep thought, and when they came now into full view, she cried
      out joyously: &ldquo;Buck, oh Buck!&rdquo; and ran towards them. Even the burros
      stopped and the men stood statue-like; it is rarely enough that one finds
      a human being in those mountains, almost an act of Providence that lead to
      a house, and a miracle when the trail crosses the path of a friend. The
      prospectors came out of their daze with a shout and rushed to meet her.
      Each of them had her by a hand, wringing it; they talked all together in a
      storm of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate, I'm dreamin'!&mdash;Dear old Buck!&mdash;Have you forgotten me?&mdash;Lee
      Haines! I should say not.&mdash;Don't pay any attention to him. Five
      years. And I've been hungerin' to see you all that&mdash;.&mdash;Where
      have you been?&mdash;Everywhere! but this is the best thing I've seen.&mdash;Come
      in.&mdash;Wait till we get these packs off the poor little devils.&mdash;Oh,
      I'm so glad to see you; so glad!&mdash;Hurry up, Lee. Your fingers asleep?&mdash;How
      long have you been out?&mdash;Five months.&mdash;Then you're hungry.&mdash;We've
      just ate.&mdash;But a piece of pie?&mdash;pie? I've been dreamin' of pie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fire already burned in the big living-room of the cabin, for at this
      season, at such an altitude, the shadows were always cold, and around the
      fire they gathered, each of the men with half a huge pie before him. They
      were such as one might expect that mountain region to produce, big, gaunt,
      hard-muscled. They had gone unshaven for so long that their faces were
      clothed not with an unsightly stubble but with strong, short beard that
      gave them a certain grim dignity and made their eyes seem sunken. They
      were opposite types, which is usually the case when two men strike out
      together. Buck Daniels was black-haired, with an ugly, shrewd face and a
      suggestion of rather dangerous possibilities of swift action; but Lee
      Haines was a great bulk of a man, with tawny beard, handsome, in a leonine
      fashion, more poised than Daniels, fitted to crush. The sharp glance of
      Buck flitted here and there, in ten seconds he knew everything in the
      room; the steady blue eye of Lee Haines went leisurely from place to place
      and lingered; but both of them stared at Kate as if they could not have
      enough of her. They talked without pause while they ate. A stranger in the
      room would have sealed their lips in utter taciturnity, but here they sat
      with a friend, five months of loneliness and labor behind them, and they
      gossiped like girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the jangle of talk cut a thin, small voice from outside, a burst of
      laughter. Then: &ldquo;Bart, you silly dog!&rdquo; and Joan stood at the open door
      with her hand buried in the mane of the wolf-dog. The fork of Buck Daniels
      stopped halfway to his lips and Lee Haines straightened until the chair
      groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke together, hushed voices: &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Joan!&rdquo; Her face glistened with pride, and Joan came forward
      with wide eyes, tugging Black Bart along in a reluctant progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't possible!&rdquo; whispered Buck Daniels. &ldquo;Honey, come here and shake
      hands with your Uncle Buck.&rdquo; The gesture called forth deep throated
      warning from Bart, and he caught back his hand with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's always that way,&rdquo; said Kate, half amused, half vexed; &ldquo;Bart won't
      let a soul touch her when Dan isn't home. Good old Bart, go away, you
      foolish dog! Don't you see these are friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cringed a little under the shadow of the hand which waved him off but
      his only answer was a silent baring of the teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see how it is. I'm almost afraid to touch her myself when Dan's away;
      she and Bart bully me all day long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the glance of Joan had cloyed itself with sufficient
      examination of the strangers, and now she turned back towards the door and
      the meadow beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart!&rdquo; she called softly. The sharp ears of the dog quivered; he came to
      attention with a start. &ldquo;Look! Get it for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One loud scraping of his claws on the floor as he started, and Black Bart
      went like a bolt through the door with Joan scrambling after him,
      screaming with excitement; from the outside, they heard the cry of a
      frightened squirrel, and then its angry chattering from a place of safety
      up a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I call her back again?&rdquo; asked Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if Bart comes with her,&rdquo; answered Lee Haines. &ldquo;I've seen enough of
      him to last me a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll have her to ourselves when Dan comes; of course Bart leaves
      her to tag around after Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is he comin' back?&rdquo; asked Buck, with polite interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anytime. I don't know. But he's always here before it's completely dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glance of Buck Daniels kicked over to Lee Haines, exchanged meanings
      with him, and came back to Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I s'pose we'll have to be on our way
      before it's plumb dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go so soon as that? Why, I won't let you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; began Haines, fumbling for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got to get down in the valley before it's dark,&rdquo; filled in Buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she laughed, frankly, happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean, but Dan is changed; he isn't the same man he used
      to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; queried Buck, without conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to see him to believe; Buck, he doesn't even whistle any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only goes about singing, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men exchanged glances of such astonishment that Kate could not
      help but notice and flush a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; murmured Buck, &ldquo;Bart doesn't seem to have changed much from the
      old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed slowly, letting her mind run back through such happiness as
      they could not understand and when she looked up she seemed to debate
      whether or not it would be worth while to let them in on the delightful
      secret. The moment she dwelt on the burning logs they gazed at her and
      then to each other with utter amazement as if they sat in the same room
      with the dead come to life. No care of motherhood had marked her face, but
      on the white, even forehead was a sign of peace; and drifting over her
      hands and on the white apron across her lap the firelight pooled dim gold,
      the wealth of contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'd been here today you would have seen how changed he is. We had a
      man with us whom Dan had taken while he was running from a posse, wounded,
      and kept him here until he was well, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Dan,&rdquo; murmured Lee Haines. &ldquo;He's gold all through when a man's in
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Lee,&rdquo; cut in Buck. He sat forward in his chair, drinking up her
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning we saw the same posse skirting through the valley and knew
      that they were on the old trail. Dan sent Gregg over the hills and rode
      Vic's horse down so that the posse would mistake him, and he could lead
      them out of the way. I was afraid, terribly, I was afraid that if the
      posse got close and began shooting Dan would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped; her eyes begged them to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Lee Haines, shuddering slightly. &ldquo;I know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I watched him ride down the slope,&rdquo; she cried joyously, &ldquo;and I saw
      the posse close on him&mdash;almost on top of him when he reached the
      valley. I saw the flash of their guns. I saw them shoot. I wasn't afraid
      that Dan would be hurt, for he seems to wear a charm against bullets&mdash;I
      wasn't much afraid of that, but I dreaded to see him turn and go back
      through that posse like a storm. But&mdash;&rdquo; she caught both hands to her
      breast and her bright face tilted up&mdash;&ldquo;even when the bullets must
      have been whistling around him he didn't look back. He rode straight on
      and on, out of view, and I knew&rdquo;&mdash;her voice broke with emotion&mdash;&ldquo;oh,
      Buck, I knew that he had won, and I had won; that he was safe forever;
      that there was no danger of him ever slipping back into that terrible
      other self; I knew that I'd never again have to dream of that whistling in
      the wind; I knew that he was ours&mdash;Joan's and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God,&rdquo; broke out Buck, &ldquo;I'm happier than if you'd found a gold mine,
      Kate. It don't seem no ways&mdash;but if you seen that with your own eyes,
      it's possible true. He's changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been almost afraid to be happy all these years,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but now
      I want to sing and cry at the same time. My heart is so full that it's
      overflowing, Buck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She brushed the tears away and smiled at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all about yourselves. Everything. You first, Lee. You've been
      longer away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer for a moment, but sat with his head fallen, watching her
      thoughtfully. Women had been the special curse in Lee Haines' life; they
      had driven him to the crime that sent him West into outlawry long years
      before; through women, as he himself foreboded, he would come at last to
      some sordid, petty end; but here sat the only one he had loved without
      question, without regret, purely and deeply, and as he watched her, more
      beautiful than she had been in her girlhood, it seemed, as he heard the
      fitful laughter of Joan outside, the old sorrow came storming up in him,
      and the sense of loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I been doing?&rdquo; he murmured at length. He shrugged away his last
      thoughts. &ldquo;I drifted about for a while after the pardon came down from the
      governor. People knew me, you see, and what they knew about me didn't
      please them. Even today Jim Silent and Jim Silent's crew isn't forgotten.
      Then don't look at me like that, Kate; no, I played straight all the time&mdash;-then
      I ran into Buck and he and I had tried each other out, we had at least one
      thing in common&rdquo;&mdash;here he looked at Buck and they both flushed&mdash;&ldquo;and
      we made a partnership of it. We've been together five years now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you could break away, Lee. I used to tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You helped me more than you knew,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and then turned to escape him. &ldquo;And now you, Buck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since then we've made a bit of coin punching cows and we've blown it in
      again prospecting. Blown it in? Kate, we've shot enough powder to lift
      that mountain yonder but all we've got is color. You could gild the sky
      with what we've seen but we haven't washed enough dust to wear a hole in a
      tissue-paper pocket. I'll tell you the whole story. Lee packs a jinx with
      him. But&mdash;Haines, did you ever see a lion as big as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dimness of evening had grown rapidly through the room while they
      talked and now the light from the door was far less than the glow of the
      fire. The yellow flicker picked out a dozen pelts stretching as rugs on
      the floor or hanging along the wall; that to which Buck pointed was an
      enormous skin of a mountain lion stretched sidewise, for if it had been
      hung straight up a considerable portion of the tail must have dragged on
      the floor. Buck went to examine it. Presently he exclaimed in surprise and
      he passed his fingers over it as though searching for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was it shot, Kate? I don't find nothin' but this cut that looks
      like his knife slipped when he was skinnin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a knife that killed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask me about it; I see the picture of it in my dreams still. The
      lion had dragged the trap into a cave and Bart followed it. Dan went in
      pushing his rifle before him, but&mdash;when he tried to fire it jammed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; they cried together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask me the rest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They would hardly have let her off so easily if it had not been for the
      entrance of Joan who had come back on account of the darkness. Black Bart
      went promptly to a corner of the hearth and lay down with his head on his
      paws and the little girl sat beside him watching the fire, her head
      leaning wearily on his shoulder. Kate went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's almost night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why isn't he here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buck, they couldn't have overtaken&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started. &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buck Daniels grinned reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless his hoss is a pile of bones; if it has any heart in it, Dan'll
      run away from anything on four legs. No call for worryin', Kate. He's
      simply led 'em a long ways off and waited for evenin' before he doubled
      back. He'll come back right enough. If they didn't catch him that first
      run they'll never get the wind of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It quieted her for a time, but as the minutes slipped away, as the
      darkness grew more and more heavy until a curtain of black fell across the
      open door, they could see that she was struggling to control her trouble,
      they could see her straining to catch some distant sound. Lee Haines began
      to talk valiantly, to beguile the waiting time, and Buck Daniels did his
      share with stories of their prospecting, but eventually more and more
      often silences came on the group. They began to watch the fire and they
      winced when a log crackled, or when the sap in a green place hissed. By
      degrees they pushed farther and farther back so that the light would not
      strike so fully upon them, for in some way it became difficult to meet
      each other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Joan was perfectly at ease. She played for a time with the ears of
      Black Bart, or pried open his mouth and made him show the great white
      fangs, or scratched odd designs on the hearth with pieces of charcoal; but
      finally she lost interest in all these things and let her head lie on the
      rough pelt of the wolf-dog, sound asleep. The firelight made her hair a
      patch of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Bart slept soundly, too, that is, as soundly as one of his nature
      could sleep, for every now and then one of his ears twitched, or he
      stirred a paw, or an eyelid quivered up. Yet they all started when he
      jumped from his sleep into full wakefulness; the motion made Joan sit up,
      rubbing her eyes, and Black Bart reached the center of the room
      noiselessly. He stood facing the door, motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Dan,&rdquo; cried Kate. &ldquo;Bart hears him! Good old Bart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog pointed up his nose, the hair about his neck bristled into a ruff,
      and out of his quaking body came a sound that seemed to moan and whimper
      from the distance at first, but drew nearer, louder, packed the room with
      terror, the long drawn howl of a wolf.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XIII. Equal Payment
    </h2>
    <p>
      They knew what it meant; even Joan had heard the cry of the lone wolf
      hunting in the lean time of winter, and of all things sad, all things
      lonely, all things demoniacal, the howl of a wolf stands alone. Lee Haines
      reached for his gun, little Joan stood up silent on the hearth, but Kate
      and Buck Daniels sat listening with a sort of hungry terror, as the cry
      sobbed away to quiet. Then out of the mountains and the night came an
      answer so thin, so eerie, one might have said it was the voice of the
      mountains and white stars grown audible; it stole on the ear as the pulse
      of a heart comes to the consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly it was an answer to the cry of the wolf-dog, for in the slender
      compass it carried the same wail, the same unearthly quality with this
      great difference, that a thrilling happiness went through it, as if some
      one walked through the mountains and rejoiced in the unknown terrors. A
      sob formed in the throat of Kate and the wolf turned its head and looked
      at her, and the yellow of things that see in the night swam in its eyes.
      Lee Haines struck the arm of Buck Daniels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buck, let's get clear of this. Let's start. He's coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the whisper Buck turned a livid face; one could see him gather his
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stick,&rdquo; he said with difficulty, as though his lips were numb. &ldquo;She'll
      need me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lee Haines stood in a moment's indecision but then settled back in his
      chair and gripped his hands together. They both sat watching the door as
      if the darkness were a magnet of inescapable horror. Only Joan, of all in
      that room, showed no fear after the first moment. Her face was blanched
      indeed, but she tilted it up now, smiling; she stole towards the door, but
      Kate caught the child and gathered her close with strangling force. Joan
      made no attempt to escape. &ldquo;S-sh!&rdquo; she cautioned, and raised a plump
      little forefinger. &ldquo;Munner, don't you hear? Don't you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if the sound had turned a corner, it broke all at once clearly over
      them in a rain of music; a man's whistling. It went out; it flooded about
      them again like beautiful, cold light. Once again it stopped, and now they
      sensed, rather than heard, a light, rapid, padding step that approached
      the cabin. Dan Barry stood in the door and in that shadowy place his eyes
      seemed luminous. He no longer whistled, but a spirit went from him which
      carried the same sense of the untamed, the wild happiness which died out
      with his smile as he looked around the room. The brim of his hat curved
      up, his neckerchief seemed to flutter a little. The wolf-dog reached the
      threshold in the same instant and stood looking steadily up into the face
      of the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Dan!&rdquo; cried Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had slipped from the nerveless arms of Kate and now ran towards her
      father, but here she faltered, there she stopped with her arms slowly
      falling back to her sides. He did not seem to see her, but looked past
      her, far beyond every one in the room as he walked to the wall and took
      down a bridle that hung on a peg. Kate laid her hands on the arms of the
      chair, but after the first effort to rise, her strength failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; she said. It was only a whisper, a heart-stopping sound. &ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; Her
      voice rang, then her arms gathered to her, blindly, Joan, who had shrunk
      back. &ldquo;What's happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Molly died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They broke her leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The posse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a long shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get Satan. Go for a ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked about him, troubled, and then frowned. &ldquo;I dunno. Out yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his arm. Black Bart followed the turn of the master's body, and
      switching around in front continued to stare up into Dan's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going back after the posse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm done with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They paid for Grey Molly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shot one of their&mdash;horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help us!&rdquo; Then life came to her; she sprang up and ran between him
      and the door. &ldquo;You shan't go. If you love me!&rdquo; She was only inches from
      Black Bart, and the big animal showed his teeth in silent hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate, I'm goin'. Don't stand in the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joan, slipping around Bart, stood clinging to the skirts of her mother and
      watched the face of Dan, fascinated, silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me where you're going. Tell me when you're coming back. Dan, for
      pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loud as a trumpet, a horse neighed from the corral. Dan had stood with an
      uncertain face, but now he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'you hear? I got to go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Satan whinney. But what does that mean? How does that make you
      go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;something's happening. I felt it on the wind
      when I was comin' up the pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&mdash;oh, Dan, you're breaking my heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand out of the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see I can't wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hour, ten minutes. Buck&mdash;Lee Haines&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not finish, but Buck Daniels stepped closer, trying to make a
      smile grow on his ashen face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another minute, Dan, and I'll tell a man you've forgotten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barry pivoted suddenly as though uneasy at finding something behind him,
      and Daniels winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Buck. Didn't see you was here. Lee Haines? Lee, this is fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed from one to the other and his handshake was only the elusive
      passage of his fingers through their palms. Haines shrugged his shoulders
      to get rid of a weight that clung to him; a touch of color came back to
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Dan. If you're afraid that gang may trail you here and start
      raising the devil&mdash;how many are there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm as good with a gun as I ever was in the old days. So is Buck.
      Partner, let's make the show down together. Stick here with Kate and Joan
      and Buck and I will help you hold the fort. Don't look at me like that. I
      mean it. Do you think I've forgotten what you did for me that night in
      Elkhead? Not in a thousand years. Dan, I'd rather make my last play here
      than any other place in the world. Let 'em come! We'll salt them down and
      plant them where they won't grow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he talked the pallor quite left him, and the fighting fire blazed in
      his eyes, he stood lion-like, his feet spread apart as if to meet a shock,
      his tawny head thrown back, and there was about him a hair-trigger
      sensitiveness, in spite of his bulk, a nervousness of hand and coldness of
      glance which characterizes the gun-fighter. Buck Daniels stepped closer,
      without a word, but one felt that he also had walked into the alliance. As
      Barry watched them the yellow which swirled in his eyes flickered away for
      a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, gents,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;they ain't any call for trouble. The posse?
      What's that got to do with me? Our accounts are all squared up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two stared dumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They killed Grey Molly; I killed one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horse&mdash;for a man?&rdquo; repeated Lee Haines, breathing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A life for a life,&rdquo; said Dan simply. &ldquo;They got no call for complainin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glances of wonder, glances of meaning, flashed back and forth from Haines
      to Buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the latter, and he took in Kate with a caution from the
      corner of his eye, &ldquo;if that's the case, let's sit down and chin for a
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan stood with his head bowed a little, frowning; two forces pulled him,
      and Kate leaned against the wall off in the shadow with her eyes closed,
      waiting, waiting, waiting through the crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to stay and chin with you, Buck&mdash;but, I got to be off. Out
      there&mdash;in the night&mdash;something may happen before mornin'.&rdquo; Black
      Bart licked the hand of the master and whined. &ldquo;Easy, boy. We're
      startin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the night's just beginnin',&rdquo; said Buck Daniels genially. &ldquo;You got a
      world of time before you, and with Satan to fall back on you don't have to
      count your minutes. Pull up a chair beside me, Dan, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter shook his head, decided. &ldquo;Buck, I can't do it. Just to sit
      here&rdquo;&mdash;he looked about him&mdash;&ldquo;makes me feel sort of choked. Them
      walls are as close&mdash;as a coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was already turning; Kate straightened in the shadow, desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact, Dan,&rdquo; said Lee Haines, suddenly, &ldquo;we need your help
      badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heart of Kate stood in her eyes as she looked at Lee Haines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down a minute, Dan, and I'll tell you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barry slipped into a chair which he had pulled to one side&mdash;so that
      the back of it was towards the wall, and every one in the room was before
      him.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIV. Suspense
    </h2>
    <p>
      The help which Lee Haines wanted, it turned out, was guidance across a
      difficult stretch of country which he and Buck Daniels wanted to prospect,
      and while he talked Barry listened uneasily. It was constitutionally
      impossible for him to say no when a favor was asked of him, and Haines
      counted heavily on that characteristic; in the meantime Black Bart lay on
      the hearth with his wistful eyes turned steadily up to the master; and
      Buck Daniels went to Kate on the farther side of the room. She sat
      quivering, alternately crushing and soothing Joan with the strength of her
      caresses. Buck drew a chair close, with his back half towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn around a little, Kate,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;Don't let Dan see your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed him automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a hope, Buck? What have I done to deserve this? I don't want to
      live; I want to die! I want to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, steady!&rdquo; he cut in, and his face was working. &ldquo;If you keep on
      like this you'll bust down in a minute or two. And you know what tears do
      to Dan; he'll be out of this house like a scairt coyote. Brace up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She struggled and won a partial control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm fighting hard, Buck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight harder still. You ought to know him better than I do. When he's
      like this it drives him wild to have other folks thinkin' about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked over to Dan. In spite of the bowed head of the latter as he
      listened to Haines yarning he gave an impression of electric awareness to
      all that was around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk soft,&rdquo; whispered Buck. &ldquo;Maybe he knows we're talkin' about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his voice out of the whisper, breaking in on a sentence about
      Joan, as if this were the tenor of their talk. Then he lowered his tone
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think quick. Talk soft. Do you want Dan kept here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose the posse gets him here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We musn't dodge the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were gauging their voices with the closest precision. Talking like
      this so close to Barry was like dancing among flasks of nitroglycerine.
      Once, and once only, Lee Haines cast a desperate eye across to them,
      begging them to come to his rescue, then he went back to his talk with
      Dan, raising his voice to shelter the conference of the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they come, he'll fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he isn't at the fighting pitch yet, I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're wrong they'll be dead men here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sees no difference between the death of a horse and the death of a
      man. He feels that the law has no score against him. He'll go quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we'll find ways of fightin' the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it needs money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Buck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate, he's gone already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say he's gone. Look at his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The yaller is comin' up in 'em. He's wild again.&rdquo; She shook her head in
      mute agony. Buck Daniels groaned, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they's goin' to be a small-sized hell started around this cabin
      before mornin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and went slowly back towards the fire. Lee Haines was talking
      steadily, leisurely, going round and round his subject again and again,
      and Barry listened with bowed head, but his eyes were fixed upon those of
      the wolf-dog at his feet. When he grew restless, Haines chained him to the
      chair with some direct question, yet it was a hard game to play. All this
      time the posse might be gathering around the cabin; and the forehead of
      Haines whitened and glistened with sweat. His voice was the only living
      thing in the cabin, after a time, sketching his imaginary plans for the
      benefit of Barry&mdash;his voice and the wistful eyes of Joan which kept
      steadily on Daddy Dan. Something has come between them and lifted a
      barrier which she could not understand, and with all her aching child's
      heart she wondered at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time that evening the wolf stood up on the hearth, but he
      was not yet on his feet before Dan was out of his chair and standing close
      to the wall, where the shadows swallowed him. Lee Haines sat with his lips
      frozen on the next unspoken word. Two shadows, whose feet made no sound,
      Black Bart and Dan glided to the door and peered into the night&mdash;then
      Barry went back, step by step, until his back was once more to the wall.
      Not until that instant did the others hear. It was a step which approached
      behind the house; a loud rap at the back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the very loudness of the knock which made Kate draw a breath of
      relief; if it had been a stealthy tap she would have screamed. He who
      rapped did not wait for an answer; they heard the door creak open, the
      sound of a heavy man's step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Vic,&rdquo; said Dan quietly, and then the door opened which led into the
      kitchen and the tall form of Gregg entered. He paused there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am again, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; she answered faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared his throat, embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darned if I didn't play a fool game today&mdash;hello, Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rode in a plumb circle and come back where I started.&rdquo; He laughed, and
      the laughter broke off a little shortly. He stepped to the wall and hung
      up his bridle on its peg, which is the immemorial manner of asking
      hospitality in the mountain-desert. &ldquo;Hope I ain't puttin' you out, Kate. I
      see you got company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started, recalled from her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Vic. Vic Gregg, Buck Daniels, Lee Haines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands, and Vic detained Haines a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me I've heard of you, Haines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregg looked at the big man narrowly, and then swung back towards Dan. He
      knew many things, now. Lee Haines&mdash;yes, that was the name. One of the
      crew who followed Jim Silent; and Dan Barry? What a fool he had been not
      to remember! It was Dan Barry who had gone on the trail of Silent's gang
      and hounded it to death; Lee Haines alone had been spared. Yes, half a
      dozen years before the mountain-folk had heard that story, a wild and
      improbable one. It fitted in with what Pete Glass had told him of the
      shooting of Harry Fisher; it explained a great deal which had mystified
      him since he first met Barry; it made the thing he had come to do at once
      easier and harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s'pose Molly showed a clean pair of heels to the whole lot of 'em?&rdquo; he
      said to Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; His astonishment was well enough affected. &ldquo;God amighty, Dan, not
      Grey Molly&mdash;my hoss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead. I shot her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vic gasped. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'd busted her leg. I put her out of pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregg dropped into a chair. It was not altogether an affectation, not
      altogether a piece of skilful acting now, for though the sheriff had told
      him all that happened he had not had a chance to feel the truth; but now
      it swept over him, all her tricks, all her deviltry, all that long
      companionship. His head bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No smile touched the faces of the others in the room, but a reverent
      silence fell on the room. Then that figure among the shadows moved out,
      stepped to the side of Vic, and a light hand rested on his shoulder. The
      other looked up, haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's gone, partner,&rdquo; Dan said gently, &ldquo;but she's paid for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid for? Dan, they ain't any money could pay me back for Grey Molly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; I know! Not that way, but there was a life given for a life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One man died for Molly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the meaning came home to Gregg he blinked, and then, looking up, he
      found a change in the eyes of Barry, for they seemed to be lighted from
      within coldly, and his glance went down to the very bottom of Vic's soul,
      probing. It was only an instant, a thing of which Gregg could not make
      sure, and then Dan slipped back into his place among the shadows by the
      wall. But a chill sense of guilt, a premonition of danger, stayed in
      Gregg. The palms of his hands grew moist.

    <h2>
      Chapter XV. Seven For One
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dangerous men were no novelty for Gregg. He had lived with them, worked
      with them, as hard-fisted himself as any, and as ready for trouble, but
      the man of the mountain-desert has a peculiar dread for the practiced,
      known gun-fighter. In the days of the rapier when the art of fence grew so
      complicated that half a life was needed for its mastery, men would as soon
      commit suicide as ruffle it with an assured duellist; and the man of the
      mountain-desert has a similar respect for those who are born, it might be
      said, gun in hand. There was ample reason for the prickling in his scalp,
      Vic felt, for here he sat on an errand of consummate danger with three of
      these deadly fighters. Two of them he knew by name and repute, however
      dimly, and as for Buck Daniels, unless all signs failed the dark,
      sharp-eyed fellow was hardly less grim than the others. Vic gauged the
      three one by one. Daniels might be dreaded for an outburst of wild temper
      and in that moment he could be as terrible as any. Lee Haines would fight
      coolly, his blue eyes never clouded by passion, for that was his repute as
      the right hand man of Jim Silent, in the days when Jim had been a
      terrible, half-legendary figure. One felt that same quiet strength as the
      tawny haired man talked to Barry now; his voice was a smooth, deep
      current. But as for Barry himself, Gregg could not compute the factors
      which entered into the man. By all outward seeming that slender,
      half-timid figure was not a tithe of the force which either of the others
      represented, but out of the past Gregg's memory gathered more and more
      details, clear and clearer, of the wolf-dog, the black stallion, and the
      whistling man who tracked down Silent&mdash;&ldquo;Whistling Dan&rdquo; Barry; that
      was what they called him, sometimes. Nothing was definite in the mind of
      Gregg. The stories consisted of patched details, heard here and there at
      third or fourth hand, but he remembered one epic incident in which Barry
      had ridden, so rumor told, into the very heart of Elkhead, taken from the
      jail this very man, this Lee Haines, and carried him through the cordon of
      every armed man in Elkhead. And there was another picture, dimmer still,
      which an eye witness had painted: of how, at an appointed hour, Barry met
      Jim Silent and killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of these thoughts he glanced again at the man in the shadow, half
      expecting to find his host swollen to giant size. Instead, he found the
      same meager form, the same old suggestion of youth which would not age,
      the same pale hands, of almost feminine litheness. Lee Haines talked on&mdash;about
      a porphyry dyke somewhere to the north&mdash;a ledge to be found in the
      space of ten thousand square miles&mdash;a list of vague clues&mdash;an
      appeal for Barry to help them find it&mdash;and Barry was held listening
      though ever seeming to drift, or about to drift, towards the door. Black
      Bart lay facing his master, and his snaky head followed every movement.
      Kate sat where the firelight barely touched on her, and in her arms she
      held Joan, whose face and great bright eyes were turned towards Daddy Dan.
      All things in the room centered on the place where the man sat by the
      wall, and the sense of something impending swept over Gregg; then a wild
      fear&mdash;did they know the danger outside? He must make conversation; he
      turned to Kate, but at the same moment the voice of Buck Daniels beside
      him, close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how you feel, old man. I remember an old bay hoss of mine, a
      Morgan hoss, and when he died I grieved for near onto a year, mostly. He
      wasn't much of a hoss to look at, too long coupled, you'd say, and his
      legs was short, but he got about like a coyote and when he sat down on a
      rope you couldn't budge him with a team of Percherons. That's how good he
      was! When he was a four year old I was cutting out yearlin's with him, and
      how&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The loud, cheerful tone fell away to a confidential murmur, Daniels leaned
      closer, with a smile of prospective humor, but the words which came to
      Gregg were: &ldquo;Partner, if I was you I'd get up and git and I wouldn't stop
      till I put a hell of a long ways between me and this cabin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It spoke well of Vic's nerve that no start betrayed him. He bowed his head
      a little, as though to catch the trend of the jolly story better, nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong?&rdquo; he muttered back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barry's watchin' you out of the shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then: &ldquo;You fool, don't look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was method in Vic's raising his head. He threw it back and broke
      into laughter, but while he laughed he searched the shadow by the wall
      where Dan sat, and he felt glimmering eyes fixed steadily upon him. He
      dropped his head again, as if to hear more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's it mean, Daniels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know. I don't. But he don't mean you no good. He's lookin'
      at you too steady. If I was you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the whisper of Buck, through the loud, steady talk of Lee Haines,
      cut the voice of Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter looked up and found that Barry was standing just within the
      glow of the hearth-light and something about him made Gregg's heart
      shrink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic, how much did they pay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to answer; he would have given ten years of life to have his
      voice under control for an instant; but his tongue froze. He knew that
      every one had turned toward him and he tried to smile, look unconcerned,
      but in spite of himself his eyes were wide, fixed, and he felt that they
      could stare into the bottom of his soul and see the guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his voice came, but he could have groaned when he heard its crazily
      shaken, shrill sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'you mean, Dan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled and Gregg added hastily: &ldquo;If you want me to be movin'
      along, Dan, of course you're the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did they pay?&rdquo; repeated the quiet, inexorable voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could have stood that, even without much fear, for no matter how
      terrible the man might be in action his hands were tied in his own house;
      but now Kate spoke: &ldquo;Vic, what have you done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it came, in a flood. Hot shame rolled through him and the words burst
      out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a yaller houn'-dog, a sneakin' no-good cur! Dan, you're right. I've
      sold you. They're out there, all of 'em, waitin' in the rocks. For God's
      sake take my gun and pump me full of lead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw his arms out, clear of his holster and turned that Barry might
      draw his revolver. Vaguely he knew that Haines and Buck had drawn swiftly
      close to him from either side; vaguely he heard the cry of Kate; but all
      that he clearly understood was the merciless, unmoved face of Barry. It
      was pretense; with all his being he wanted to die, but when Barry made no
      move to strike he turned desperately to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do the job for him. He saved my life and then I used it to sell him.
      Daniels, Haines, I got no use for livin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take&mdash;this!&mdash;and march to your friends outside;
      and when you get through them, plant a forty-five slug in your own dirty
      heart and then rot.&rdquo; Haines held out his gun with a gesture of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kate slipped in front of him, white and anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the girl you told me about, Vic?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You did it to get
      back to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan, let him go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got no thought of usin' him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; cried Vic suddenly. &ldquo;I'll do the way Haines said. Or else let
      me stay here and fight 'em off with you. Dan, for God's sake give me one
      chance to make good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was like talking to a face of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door's open for you, and waitin'. One thing before you go. That's the
      same gang you told me about before? Ronicky Joe, Harry Fisher, Gus Reeve,
      Mat Henshaw, Sliver Waldron and Pete Glass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry Fisher's dead, Dan, if you'll give me one fightin' chance to play
      square now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell 'em that I know 'em. Tell 'em one thing more. I thought Grey Molly
      was worth only one man. But I was wrong. They've done me dirt and played
      crooked. They come huntin' me&mdash;with a decoy. Now tell 'em from me
      that Grey Molly is worth seven men, and she's goin' to be paid for in
      full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped to the wall and took down the bridle which Vic had hung there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you'll be needin' this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It ended all talk; it even seemed to Gregg that as soon as he received the
      bridle from the hand of Barry the truce ended with a sudden period and war
      began. He turned slowly away.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVI. Man-Hunting
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Vic Gregg left the house, the new moon peered at him over a black
      mountain-top, a sickle of white with a half imaginary line rounding the
      rest of the circle, and to the shaken mind of Vic it seemed as if a
      ghostly spectator had come out to watch the tragedy among the peaks. At
      the line of the rocks the sheriff spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gregg, you've busted your contract. You didn't bring him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vic threw his revolver on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bust the rest of it here and now. I'm through. Put on your irons and
      take me back. Hang me and be damned to you, but I'll do no more to
      double-cross him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sliver Waldron drew from his pocket something which jangled faintly, but
      the sheriff stopped him with a word. He sat up behind his rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got an idea, Gregg, that you've finished up your job and double-crossed
      us! Does he know that I'm out here? Sit down there out of sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do that,&rdquo; said Gregg, obeying, &ldquo;because you got the right to make
      me, but you ain't got the right to make me talk, and nothin' this side of
      hell can pry a word out of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff drew down his brows until his eyes were merely cavities of
      blackness. Very tenderly he fondled the rifle-butt which lay across his
      knees, and never in the mountain-desert had there been a more humbly
      unpretentious figure of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Vic, I been thinkin' that you had the man-sized makin's of a
      skunk, but I'm considerable glad to see I've judged you wrong. Sit quiet
      here. I ain't goin' to put no irons on you if you give me your parole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see you in hell before I give you nothin'. I was a man, or a
      partways man, till I met up with you tonight, and now I'm a houn'-dog
      that's done my partner dirt! God amighty, what made me do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He beat his knuckles against his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you've done you can't undo,&rdquo; answered the sheriff. &ldquo;Vic, I've seen
      gents do considerable worse than you've done and come clean afterwards.
      You're goin' to get off for what you've done to Blondy, and you're goin'
      to live straight afterwards. You're goin' to get married and you're goin'
      to play white. Why, man, I had to use you as far as I could. But you think
      I wanted you to bring me out Barry? You couldn't look Betty square in the
      face if you'd done what you set out to do. Now, I ain't pressin' you, but
      I done some scouting while you was away, and I heard four men's voices in
      the house. Can you tell me who's there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've played square, Pete,&rdquo; answered Vic hoarsely, &ldquo;and I'll do my part.
      Go down and get on your hosses and ride like hell; because in ten minutes
      you're goin' to have three bad ones around your necks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A mutter came from the rest of the posse, for this was rather more than
      they had planned ahead. The sheriff, however, only sighed, and as the
      moonlight increased Vic could see that he was deeply, childishly
      contented, for in the heart of the little dusty man there was that
      inextinguishable spark, the love of battle. Chance had thrown him on the
      side of the law, but sooner or later dull times were sure to come and then
      Pete Glass would cut out work of his own making go bad. The love of the
      man-trail is a passion that works in two ways, and they who begin by
      hunting will in the end be the hunted; the mountain-desert is filled with
      such histories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three to five,&rdquo; said the sheriff, &ldquo;sounds more interestin', Vic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden passion to destroy that assured calm rose in Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three common men might make you a game,&rdquo; he said, glowering, &ldquo;but them
      ain't common ones. One of 'em I don't know, but he has a damned nervous
      hand. Another is Lee Haines!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had succeeded in part, at least. The sheriff sat bolt erect; he seemed
      to be hearing distant music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lee Haines!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;That was Jim Silent's man. They say he was as
      fast with a gun as Jim himself.&rdquo; He sighed again. &ldquo;They's nothing like a
      big man, Vic, to fill your sights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daniels and Haines, suppose you count them off agin' the rest of your
      gang, Pete. That leaves Barry for you.&rdquo; He grinned maliciously. &ldquo;D'you
      know what Barry it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a kind of common name, Vic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete, have you heard of Whistlin' Dan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No doubt about it, he had burst the confidence of the sheriff into
      fragments. The little man began to pant and even in the dim light Vic
      could see that his face was working.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him!&rdquo; he said at length. And then: &ldquo;I might of knowed! Him!&rdquo; He leaned
      closer. &ldquo;Keep it to yourself, Vic, or you'll have the rest of the boys
      runnin' for cover before the fun begins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snuggled a little closer to his rock and turned his head towards the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him!&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Columbus, when he saw the land of his dream wavering blue in the distance,
      might have hailed it with such a heart-filling whisper, and Vic knew that
      when these two met, these two slender, small men&mdash;with the uneasy
      hands, there would be a battle whose fame would ring from range to range.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they was only a bit more light,&rdquo; muttered the sheriff. &ldquo;My God, Vic,
      why ain't the moon jest a mite nearer the full!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that, not a word for a long time until the lights in the house were
      suddenly extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they won't show up agin no background when they make their run,&rdquo;
       murmured the sheriff. He pushed up his hat brim so that it covered his
      eyes more perfectly. &ldquo;Boys, get ready. They're comin' now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mat Henshaw took up the word, and repeated it, and the whisper ran down
      the line of men who lay irregularly among the rocks, until at last Sliver
      Waldron brought it to a stop with a deep murmur. Not even a whisper could
      altogether disguise his booming bass. It seemed to Vic Gregg that the air
      about him grew more tense; his arm muscles commenced to ache from the
      gripping of his hands. Then a door creaked&mdash;they could tell the
      indubitable sound as if there were a light to see it swing cautiously
      wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're goin' out the back way,&rdquo; interpreted the sheriff, &ldquo;but they'll
      come around in front. They ain't any other way they can get out of here.
      Pass that down the line, Mat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the whisper had trailed out half its course, a woman screamed in
      the house. It sent a jag of lightning through the brain of Vic Gregg; he
      started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down,&rdquo; commanded the sheriff 'curtly. &ldquo;Or they'll plant you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, Pete, he's killin' his wife&mdash;an'&mdash;he's gone mad&mdash;I
      seen it comin' in his eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; muttered Glass, &ldquo;an' listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pulse of sound floated out to them, and stopped the breath of Gregg; it
      was a deep, stifled sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's begged him to stay with her; he's gone,&rdquo; said the sheriff. &ldquo;Now
      it'll come quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the sheriff was wrong. There was not a sound, not a sign of a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently: &ldquo;What sort of a lass is she, Gregg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All yaller hair, Pete, and the softes' blue eyes you ever see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff made no answer, but Vic saw the little bony hand tense about
      the barrel of the rifle. Still that utter quiet, with the pulse of the
      sobbing lying like a weight upon the air, and the horror of the waiting
      mounted and grew, like peak upon peak before the eyes of the climber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch for 'em sneakin' up on us through the rocks. Watch for 'em close,
      lads. It ain't goin' to be a rush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the sibilant murmur ran down the line, and the voice of Sliver
      Waldron brought it faintly to a period.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three of 'em,&rdquo; continued the sheriff, &ldquo;and most likely they'll come at us
      three ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the shadow Vic watched the lips of Glass work and caught the end
      of his soft murmur to himself: &ldquo;.... all three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood; the sheriff had offered up a deep prayer that all three
      might fall by his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up from the farther end of the line the whisper ran lightly, swiftly, with
      a stammer of haste in it: &ldquo;To the right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ay, there to the right, gliding from the corner of the house, went a dark
      form, and then another, and disappeared among the rocks. They had offered
      not enough target for even chance shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold for close range&rdquo; ordered the sheriff, and the order was repeated.
      However much he might wish to win all the glory of the fray, the sheriff
      took no chances&mdash;threw none of his odds away. He was a methodical
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight patter caught the ear of Vic, like the running of many small
      children over a heavy carpet, and then two shades blew around the side of
      the house, one small and scudding close to the ground, the other vastly
      larger&mdash;a man on horseback. It seemed a naked horse at first, so
      close to the back did the rider lean, and before Vic could see clearly the
      vision burst on them all. Several things kept shots from being fired
      earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first alarm had called attention to the opposite side of the house
      from that on which the rider appeared; then, the moon gave only a vague,
      treacherous light, and the black horse blended into it&mdash;the grass
      lightened the fall of his racing feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a ship driving through a fog they rushed into view, the black
      stallion, and Bart fleeting in front, and the surprise was complete. Vic
      could see it work even in the sheriff, for the latter, having his rifle
      trained towards his right jerked it about with a short curse and blazed at
      the new target, again, again, and the line of the posse joined the fire.
      Before the crack of their guns went from the ears of Vic, long before the
      echoes bellowed back from the hills, Satan leaped high up. Perhaps that
      change of position saved both it and its rider. Straight across the pale
      moon drove the body with head stretched forth, ears back, feet gathered
      close&mdash;a winged horse with a buoyant figure upon it. It cleared a
      five foot rock, and rushed instantly out of view among the boulders. The
      fugitive had fired only one shot, and that when the stallion was at the
      crest of its leap.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVII. The Second Man
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sheriff was on his feet, whining with eagerness and with the rest of
      his men he sent a shower of lead splashing vainly into the deeper night
      beside the mountain, where the path wound down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's done! Hold up, lads!&rdquo; called Pete Glass. &ldquo;He's beat us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The firing ceased, and they heard the rush of the hoofs along the graveled
      slope and the clanging on rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's done,&rdquo; repeated the sheriff. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he stood staring blankly, with a touch or horror in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, Mat's plugged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mat Henshaw? Wha&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clean through the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lay in an oddly twisted heap, as though every bone in his body were
      broken, and when they drew him about they found the red mark in his
      forehead and even made out the dull surprise in his set face. There had
      been no pain in that death, the second for the sake of Grey Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other two!&rdquo; said the sheriff, more to himself than to Vic, who stood
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, Pete,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;You got nothin' agin Haines and Daniels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff flashed at him that hungry, baffled glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I can find something. You Gregg, keep your mouth shut and stand
      back. Halloo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent a long call quavering between the lonely mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You yonder&mdash;Lee Haines! D'you give up to the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A burst of savage laughter flung back at him, and then: &ldquo;Why the hell
      should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haines, I give you fair warnin'! For resistin' the law and interferin', I
      ask you, do you surrender?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big voice fairly swallowed the rather shrill tone of the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sheriff Pete Glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie. Whoever heard of a sheriff come sneakin' round like a coyote
      lookin' for dead meat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete Glass grinned with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haines, you ain't much better'n spoiled meat if you keep back. I gave you
      till I count ten&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you bob-tailed skunk,&rdquo; shouted a new voice. &ldquo;You bone-spavined,
      pink-eyed rat-catcher,&rdquo; continued this very particular describer, &ldquo;what
      have you got on us? Come out and dicker and we'll do the same!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff sighed, softly, deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought maybe they wouldn't get down to talk,&rdquo; he murmured. But since
      the last chance for a battle was gone, he stepped fearlessly from behind
      his rock and advanced into the open. Two tall figures came to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Lee Haines, stalking forward. &ldquo;One bad move, just the glint of
      a single gun from the rest of you sheep thieves, and I'll tame your pet
      sheriff and send him to hell for a model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They halted, close to each other, the two big men, Haines in the front,
      and the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're Lee Haines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've named me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're Buck Daniels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gents, you've resisted an officer of the law in the act of makin' an
      arrest. I s'pose you know what that means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Lee Haines laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't start a bluff, sheriff. I know a bit about the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe by experience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an odd thing to watch the three, every one of them a practiced
      fighter, every one of them primed for trouble, but each ostentatiously
      keeping his hands away from the holsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we might have done if we had come to a pinch,&rdquo; said Haines, &ldquo;is one
      thing, and what we did do is another. Barry was started and off before we
      had a chance to show teeth, my friend, and you never even caught the flash
      of our guns. If he'd waited but he didn't. There's nothing left for us to
      do except say good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little dusty man stroked his moustaches thoughtfully. He had gone out
      there hoping against hope that his chance might come&mdash;to trick the
      two into violence, even to start an arrest for reasons which he knew his
      posse would swear to; but it must be borne in mind that Pete Glass was a
      careful man by instinct. Taking in probable speed of hand and a thousand
      other details at a glance, Pete sensed the danger of these two and felt in
      his heart of hearts that he was more than master of either of them,
      considered alone; better than Buck Daniels by an almost safe margin of
      steadiness; better than Lee Haines by a flickering instant of speed. Had
      either of them alone faced him, he would have taken his chance, perhaps,
      to kill or be killed, for the long trail and the escape had fanned that
      spark within him to a cold, hungry fire; but to attempt a play with both
      at the same time was death, and he knew it. Seeing that the game was up,
      he laid his cards on the table with characteristic frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gents,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I reckon you've come clean with me. You ain't my meat
      and I ain't goin' to clutter up your way. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;even in the dull
      moonshine they caught the humorous glint of his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;a friend is a
      friend, and I'll say I'm glad that you didn't step into the shady side of
      the law while Barry was gettin' away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one could know what it cost Pete Glass to be genial at that instant,
      for this night he felt that he had just missed the great moment which he
      had yearned for since the day when he learned to love the kick of a
      six-shooter against the heel of his hand. It was the desire to meet face
      to face one whose metal of will and mind was equal to his own, whose
      nerves were electric energies perfectly under command, whose muscles were
      fine spun steel. He had gone half a lifetime on the trail of fighters and
      always he had known that when the crisis came his hand would be the
      swifter, his eyes the more steady; the trailing was a delight always, but
      the actual kill was a matter of slaughter rather than a game of hazard.
      Only the rider of the black stallion had given him the sense of equal
      power, and his whole soul had risen for the great chance of All. That
      chance was gone; he pushed the thought of it away&mdash;for the time&mdash;and
      turned back to the business at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They's only one thing,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Sliver! Ronicky! Step along, gents,
      and we'll have a look at the insides of that house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; broke in Haines. He barred the path to the front door. &ldquo;Sheriff,
      you don't know me, but I'm going to ask you to take my word for what's in
      that house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glass swept him with a look of a new nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got an idea your word might do. Well, what's in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little five-year-old girl and her mother; nothing else worth seeing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else,&rdquo; considered the sheriff, &ldquo;but that's quite a lot. Maybe his
      wife could tell me where he's going? Give me an idea where I might call on
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partner, you can't see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-m-m!&rdquo; murmured the sheriff. He watched the big man plant himself,
      swaying a little on his feet as though poising for action, and beside him
      a slightly smaller figure not less determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl in there is old man Cumberlan's daughter,&rdquo; said Daniels, &ldquo;and
      no matter what her&mdash;what Dan Barry may be, Kate Cumberland is white
      folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff remembered what Vic had said of yellow hair and soft blue
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leastways,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she seems to have a sort of way with the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheriff you're on a cold trail,&rdquo; said Haines. &ldquo;Inside that house is just
      a heart-broken girl and her baby. If you want to see them&mdash;go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might know something,&rdquo; mused the sheriff, &ldquo;and I s'pose I'd ought to
      pry it out of her right now: but I don't care for that sort of pickin's.&rdquo;
       He repeated softly: &ldquo;A girl and a baby!&rdquo; and turned on his heel. &ldquo;All
      right, boys, climb your hosses. Two of you take Mat. We'll bury him where
      we put Harry. I guess we can pack him that far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; This from Haines. &ldquo;One of your gang dropped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They followed him and stood presently beside the body. Aside from the red
      mark in the forehead he seemed asleep, and smiling at some pleasant dream;
      a handsome fellow in the strength of first manhood, this man who was the
      second to die for Grey Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the end of Dan Barry,&rdquo; said Buck. &ldquo;Lee, we'll never have Whistlin'
      Dan for a friend again. He's wild for good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff turned and eyed him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got to come back,&rdquo; said Haines. &ldquo;He's got to come back for the sake
      of Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd better be dead for the sake of Kate,&rdquo; answered Buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, partner, this isn't the first time he's gone wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see, Lee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's fighting to kill. He's shooting to kill, and he ain't ever done that
      before. He crippled his men; he put 'em out of the way with a busted leg
      or a plugged shoulder; but now he's out to finish 'em. Lee, he'll never
      come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked to the white face of Vic Gregg, standing by, and he said without
      anger; &ldquo;Maybe it ain't your fault, but you've started a pile of harm. Look
      at these gents around you, the sheriff and all&mdash;they're no better'n
      dead, Gregg, and that's all along of you. Barry has started on the trail
      of all of you. Look at that house back there. It's packed full of hell,
      and all along of you. Lee, let's get back. I'm feelin' sick inside.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XVIII. Concerning The Strength Of Women
    </h2>
    <p>
      There were three things discussed by Lee Haines and Buck Daniels in the
      dreary days which followed. The first was to keep on their way across the
      mountains and cut themselves away from the sorrow of that cabin. The
      second was to strike the trail of Barry and hunt until they found his
      refuge and attempt to lead him back to his family. The third was simply to
      stay on and where they found the opportunity, help Kate. They discarded
      the first idea without much talk; it would be yellow, they decided, and
      the debt they owed to the Dan Barry of the old days was too great to be
      shouldered off so easily: they cast away the second thought still more
      quickly, for the trail which baffled the shrewd sheriff, as they knew,
      would be too much for them. It remained to stay with Kate, making
      excursions through the mountains from day to day to maintain the pretence
      of carrying on their own business, and always at hand in time of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no easy part to play, for in the house they found Kate more and
      more silent, more and more thoughtful, never speaking of her trouble, but
      behind her eyes a ghost of waiting that haunted them. If the wind shrilled
      down the pass, if a horse neighed from the corral, there was always the
      start in her, the thrill of hope, and afterwards the pitiful deadening of
      her smile. She was not less beautiful they thought, as she grew paler, but
      the terrible silence of the place drove them away time and again. Even
      Joan no longer pattered about the house, and when they came down out of
      the mountains they never heard her shrill laughter. She sat cross-legged
      by the hearth in her old place during the evenings with her chin resting
      on one hand and her eyes fixed wistfully upon the fire; and sometimes they
      found her on the little hillock behind the house, from the top of which
      she could view every approach to the cabin. Of Dan and even of Black Bart,
      her playmate she soon learned not to speak, for the mention of them made
      her mother shrink and whiten. Indeed, the saddest thing in that house was
      the quiet in which the child waited, waited, waited, and never spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain't more'n a baby,&rdquo; said Buck Daniels, &ldquo;and you can leave it to
      time to make her forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; growled Lee Haines, &ldquo;Kate isn't a baby. Buck, it drives me damn
      near crazy to see her fade this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you lay to this,&rdquo; answered Buck. &ldquo;She'll pull through. She'll never
      forget, maybe, but she'll go on livin' for the sake of the kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know a hell of a lot about women, don't you?&rdquo; said Haines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know enough, son,&rdquo; nodded Buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, in fact, reduced women to a few distinct categories, and he only
      waited to place a girl in her particular class before he felt quite
      intimate acquaintance with her entire mind and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll kill her,&rdquo; pronounced Lee Haines. &ldquo;Why, she's like a flower, Buck,
      and sorrow will cut her off at the root. Think of a girl like that thrown
      away in these damned deserts! It makes me sick&mdash;sick! She ought to
      have nothing but velvet to touch&mdash;nothing but a millionaire for a
      husband, and never a worry in her life.&rdquo; He grew excited. &ldquo;But here's the
      flower thrown away and the heel crushing it without mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buck Daniels regarded him with pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel kind of sorry for you, Lee, when I hear you talk about girls. No
      wonder they make a fool of you. A flower crushed under the foot, eh? You
      just listen to me, my boy. You and me figure to be pretty hard, don't we?
      Well, soft pine stacked up agin' quartzite, is what we are compared to
      Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lee Haines gaped at him, too astonished to be angry. He suggested
      softening of the brain to Buck, but the latter waved aside the
      implications.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, supposin' Kate was one of these dark girls with eyes like black
      diamonds and a lot of snap and zip to her. If she was like that I s'pose
      you'd figure her to forget all about Dan inside of a month&mdash;and maybe
      marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You be damned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I am. Them hard, snappy lookin' girls are the ones that smash.
      They're brittle, that's why; but you take a soft lookin' girl like Kate,
      maybe she ain't a diamond point to cut glass, but she's tempered steel
      that'll bend, and bend, and bend, and then when you wait for it to break
      it flips up and knocks you down. That's Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lee Haines rolled a cigarette in silence. He was too disgusted to answer,
      until his first puff of smoke dissolved Buck in a cloud of thin blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to sing to a congregation instead of to cows, Buck. You have
      the tune, and you might get by in a church; but cows have sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate will buckle and bend and fade for a while,&rdquo; went on Buck, wholly
      unperturbed, &ldquo;but just when you go out to pick daisies for her you'll come
      back and find her singing to the stove. Her strength is down deep, like
      some of these outlaw hosses that got a filmy, sleepy lookin' eye. They
      save their hell till you sink the spurs in 'em. You think she loves Dan,
      don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a faint suspicion of it,&rdquo; sneered Haines. &ldquo;I suppose I'm wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buck, I may have slipped a nickel into you, but you're playing the wrong
      tune. Knock off and talk sense, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you grow up, son, you'll understand some of the things I'm tryin' to
      explain in words of one syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She don't love Dan. She thinks she does, but down deep they ain't a
      damned thing in the world she gives a rap about exceptin' Joan. Men? What
      are they to her? Marriage? That's simply an accident that's needed so she
      can have a baby. Delicate, shrinkin' flower, is she? I tell you, my boy,
      if it was necessary for Joan she'd tear out your heart and mine and send
      Dan plumb to hell. You fasten on to them words, because they're gospel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was late afternoon while they talked, and they were swinging slowly
      down a gulch towards the home cabin. At that very time Kate, from the door
      of the house where she sat, saw a dark form slink from rock to rock at the
      rim of the little plateau, a motion so swift that it flicked through the
      corner of her eye, a thing to be sensed rather than seen. She set up very
      stiff, her lips white as chalk, but nothing more stirred. A few minutes
      later, when her heart was beating almost at normal she heard Joan scream
      from behind the house, not in terror, or pain, as her keen mother-ear knew
      perfectly well, but with a wild delight. She whipped about the corner of
      the house and there she saw Joan with her pudgy arms around the neck of
      Black Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart! Dear old Bart! Has he come? Has he come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she strained her eyes against the familiar mountains around her as if
      she would force her vision through rock. There was no trace of Dan, no
      sign or sound when she would even have welcomed the eerie whistle. The
      wolf-dog was already at play with Joan. She was on his back and he darted
      off in an effortless gallop, winding to and fro among the rocks. Most
      children would have toppled among the stones at the first of his swerves,
      but Joan clung like a burr, both hands dug into his hair, shrieking with
      excitement. Sometimes she reeled and almost slid at one of those lightning
      turns, for the game was to almost unseat her, but just as she was sliding
      off Bart would slacken his pace and let her find a firm seat once more.
      They wound farther and farther away, and suddenly Kate cried,
      terror-stricken: &ldquo;Joan! Come back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tug at the ear of the wolf-dog swung them around; then as they
      approached, the fear left the mind of the mother and a new thought came in
      its place. She coaxed Joan from Bart&mdash;they could play later on, she
      promised, to their heart's desire&mdash;and led her into the house. Black
      Bart followed to the door, but not all their entreaty or scolding could
      make him cross the threshold. He merely snarled at Kate, and even Joan's
      tugging at his ears could not budge him. He stood canting his head and
      watching them wistfully while Kate changed Joan's clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dressed her as if for a festival, with a blue bonnet that let the
      yellow hair curl out from the edges, and a little blue cloak, and shiny
      boots incredibly small, and around the bonnet she laid a wreath of yellow
      wild flowers. Then she wrote her letter, closed it in an envelope, and
      fastened it securely in the pocket of the cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew Joan in front of her and held her by both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan, darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;munner wants you to go with Bart up through
      the mountains. Will you be afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very decided shake of the head answered her, for Joan's eyes were
      already over her shoulder looking towards the big dog. And she was a
      little sullen at these unnecessary words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might grow dark,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You wouldn't care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Joan became a little dubious, but a whine from Bart seemed to
      reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart will keep Joan,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will. And he'll take you up through the rocks to Daddy Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the child grew brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Dan?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you get to him, take this little paper out of your pocket and
      give it to him. You won't forget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the paper to Daddy Dan,&rdquo; repeated Joan solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate dropped to her knees and gathered the little close, close, until Joan
      cried out, but when she was eased the child reached up an astonished hand,
      touched the face of Kate with awe, and then stared at her finger tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later, Joan stood in front of Black Bart, with the head of the
      wolf-dog seized firmly between her hands while she frowned intently into
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Joan to Daddy Dan,&rdquo; she ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the name, the sharp ears pricked; a speaking intelligence grew up in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giddap,&rdquo; commanded Joan, when she was in position on the back of Bart.
      And she thumped her heels against the furry ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards Kate, who stood trembling in the door, Bart cast the departing
      favor of a throat-tearing growl, and then shambled across the meadow with
      that smooth trot which wears down all other four-footed creatures. He was
      already on the far side of the meadow, and beginning the ascent of the
      first slope when the glint of the sun on the yellow wild flowers flashed
      on the eye of Kate. It had all seemed natural until that moment, the only
      possible thing to do, but now she felt suddenly that Joan was thrown away
      thought of the darkness which would soon come&mdash;remembered the yellow
      terror which sometimes gleamed in the eyes of Black Bart after nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cried out, but the wolf-dog kept swiftly on his way. She began to run,
      still calling, but rapidly as she went, Black Bart slid steadily away from
      her, and when she reached the shoulder of the mountain, she saw the dark
      form of Bart with the blue patch above it drifting up the wall of the
      opposite ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew where they were going now; it was the old cave upon which she and
      Dan had come one day in their rides, and Dan had prowled for a long time
      through the shadowy recesses.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIX. The Venture
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the moment Joan gave the name of Daddy Dan, the wolf-dog kept to the
      trail with arrowy straightness. Whatever the limitations of Bart's rather
      uncanny intelligence, upon one point he was usually letter-perfect, and
      even when a stranger mentioned Dan in the hearing of the dog it usually
      brought a whine or at least an anxious look. He hewed to his line now with
      that animal sense of direction which men can never wholly understand.
      Boulders and trees slipped away on either side of Joan; now on a descent
      of the mountain-side he broke into a lope that set the flowers fluttering
      on her bonnet; now he prowled up the ravine beyond, utterly tireless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was strictly business. When she slipped a little from her place as he
      veered around a rock he did not slow up, as usual, that she might regain
      her seat, but switched his head back with a growl that warned her into
      position. That surprise was hardly out of her mind when she saw a gay
      patch of wild-flowers a little from the line of his direction, and she
      tugged at his ear to swing him towards it. A sharp jerk of his head tossed
      her hand aside, and again she caught the glint of wild eyes as he looked
      back at her. Then she grew grave, puzzled. She trusted Black Bart with all
      her heart, as only a child can trust dumb animals, but now she sensed a
      change in him. She had guessed at a difference on that night when Dan came
      home for the last time; and the same thing seemed to be in the dog today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she could make up her mind as to what it might be, Black Bart swung
      aside up a steep slope, and whisked her into the gloom of a cave. Into the
      very heart of the darkness he glided and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Dan!&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint echo, after a moment, came back to her from the depths of the
      cave, making her voice strangely deep. Otherwise, there was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart!&rdquo; she whispered, suddenly frightened by the last murmur of that
      echo, &ldquo;Daddy Dan's not here. Go back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tugged at his ear to turn him, but again that jerk of the head freed
      his ear. He caught her by the cloak, crouched close to the floor, and she
      found herself all at once sitting on the gravelly floor of the cave with
      Bart facing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad Bart!&rdquo; she said, scrambling to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naughty dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still afraid to raise her voice in that awful silence, and in the
      dark. When she glanced around her, she made out vague forms through the
      dimness that might be the uneven walls of the cave, or might be strange
      and awful forms of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A growl that went shuddering down the cave stopped her, and now she saw
      that the eyes of Bart glowed green and yellow. Even then she could not
      believe that he would harm her, and stretched out a tentative hand. This
      time she made out the flash of his teeth as he snarled. He was no longer
      the Bart she had played with around the cabin, but a strange wild thing,
      and with a scream she darted past him toward the door. Never had those
      chubby legs flown so fast, but even as the light from the mouth of the
      cave glimmered around her, she heard a crunching on the gravel from
      behind, and then a hand, it seemed, caught her cloak and jerked her to a
      stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell sprawling, head over heels, and when she looked up, there sat
      Bart upon his haunches above her, growling terribly, and gripping the end
      of the cloak. No doubt about it now. Black Bart would have his teeth in
      her throat if she made another movement toward the entrance. A city child
      would have either gone mad with terror or else made that fatal struggle to
      reach the forbidden place, but Joan had learned many things among the
      mountains, and among others, she knew the difference between the tame and
      the free. The old dappled cow was tame, for instance; and the Maltese cat,
      which came too close to Bart the year before and received a broken back
      for its carelessness, had been tame; and the brown horse with the white
      face and the dreary eyes was tame. They could be handled, and teased, and
      petted and bossed about at will. Other creatures were different. For
      instance, the scream of the hawk always made her shrink a little closer to
      the ground, or else run helter-skelter for the house, and sometimes, up
      the gulches, she had heard the wailing of a mountain lion on the trail,
      hunting swiftly, and very hungry. There was even something about the dead
      eyes of certain lynxes and coyotes and bobcats which Daddy Dan trapped
      that made Joan feel these animals belonged to a world where the authority
      of man was only the strength of his hand or his cunning. Not that she
      phrased these thoughts in definite words, but Joan was very close to
      nature, and therefore her instincts gave her a weird little touch of
      wisdom in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she lay there tangled in her cloak and looked up into the glowing
      eyes of Bart and heard his snarling roll around her, and pass in creepy
      chills up her back, she nearly died of fear, to be sure, but she lay as
      still as still, frozen into a part of the rock. Black Bart was gone, and
      in his place was a terrible creature which belonged there among the
      shadows, for it could see in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the bright eyes disappeared, and now she saw that Bart lay
      stretched across the entrance to the cave, where the long shadow was now
      creeping down the slope. Inches by inches she ventured to sit up, and all
      it brought from Bart was a quick turn of the head and a warning growl. It
      meant as plainly as though he had spoken in so many words: &ldquo;Stay where you
      are and I don't care in the least what you do, but don't try to cross this
      entrance if you fear the length of my teeth and the keenness thereof.&rdquo; And
      she did fear them, very much, for she remembered the gashes across the
      back and the terrible rips up the side, of the dead Maltese cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She even took a little heart, after a time. A grownup cannot feel terror
      or grief as keenly as a child, but neither does terror or grief pass away
      a tithe as fast. She seemed at liberty to roam about in the cave as long
      as she did not go near the entrance, and now the shadows and the dimness
      no longer frightened her. Nothing was terrible except that long, dark body
      which lay across the entrance to the cave, and she finally got to her feet
      and began to explore. She came first on a quantity of dead grass heaped in
      a corner that was where Satan was stalled, no doubt, and it made all the
      cave seem almost homelike. She found, too, a number of stones grouped
      together with ashes in the hollow circle-that was where the fires were
      built, and there to the side lay the pile of dead wood. A little down the
      cave and directly in the center of the top, she next saw the natural
      aperture where the smoke must escape and last of all she came on the bed.
      Boughs heaped a foot thick with the blankets on top, neatly stretched out,
      and the tarpaulin over all, made a couch as soft as down and fragrant with
      the pure scent of evergreens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan tried the surface with a foot that sank to her ankle, then with her
      hands, and finally sat down to think. The first fear was almost gone; she
      understood that Bart was keeping her here until Dan came home, and fear
      does not go hand in hand with understanding. She only wondered, now, at
      the reason that kept Daddy Dan living in this cave so far from the warm
      comfort of the cabin, and so far away from her mother; but thinking makes
      small heads drowsy, and in five minutes Joan lay with her head pillowed on
      her arm, sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she awoke, the evening-gray of the cave had given place to utter
      blackness, alarming and thick. Joan sat up with a start; she would have
      cried out, bewildered, but now she heard a noise on the gravel, and turned
      to see Daddy Dan entering the cave with Satan behind him, quite distinctly
      outlined by the sunset outside. Black Bart walked first, looking back over
      his shoulder as though he led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was partly because the black, silhouetted figures awed her, somewhat,
      and partly because she wished to give Daddy Dan a gay surprise, that Joan
      did not run to him. And then, in the darkness, she heard Satan munching
      the dried grass, and the squeak and rattle as the saddle was drawn off and
      hung up, scraping against the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you been doin', Bart?&rdquo; queried the voice of Daddy Dan, and the last
      of Joan's fears fell from her as she listened. &ldquo;You act kind of worried.
      If you been runnin' rabbits all day and got your pads full of thorns I'll
      everlastin'ly treat you rough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wolf-dog whined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, speak up. What you want? Want me over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have been a trifle unearthly to most people, but Joan knew the
      ways of Daddy Dan with Satan and Black Bart. She lay quite still,
      shivering with pleasure as the footsteps approached her. Then a match
      scratched&mdash;she saw by the blue spurt of flame that he was lighting a
      pine torch, then whirling it until the flame ate down to the pitchy knot.
      He held it above his head, and now she saw him plainly: the light cascaded
      over his shoulders, glowed on his eyes, and then puffed out sidewise in a
      draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan was upon her feet, and running toward him with a cry of joy, until
      she remembered that he was not to be approached like her mother. There
      were never any bear-hugs from him, no caresses, not much laughter. She
      stopped barely in time, and stood with her fingers interlaced, staring up
      at him, half delighted, half afraid. She read his mind by microscopic
      changes in his eyes and lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner sent me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was wrong, she saw at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bart brought me.&rdquo; Much better, now. &ldquo;And oh, Daddy Dan, I've been
      lonesome for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued to stare at her for another moment, and even Joan could not
      tell whether he were angry or indifferent or pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he murmured at length, &ldquo;I guess you're hungry, Joan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew it was complete acceptance, and she could hardly keep from a
      shout of happiness. Daddy Dan had a great aversion to sudden outcries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I am,&rdquo; said Joan.

    <h2>
      Chapter XX. Discipline
    </h2>
    <p>
      He made the preparation for supper with such easy speed that everything
      seemed to be done by magic hands. When Joan's mother cooked supper there
      was always much rattling of the stove, then the building of the fire, a
      long preparation of food, and another interval when things steamed and
      sizzled on the fire. There followed the setting of the table, and then a
      long, aching time of hunger when the food was in sight, but one could not
      eat until Daddy Dan had done this, and Munner had done that. Also, when
      one did eat, half the taste was taken from things by the necessity of
      various complicated evolutions of knife and fork. Instance the absurdity
      of taking the fork under the thumb with the forefinger pressing along the
      back of the wobbly instrument, when any one could see that the proper,
      natural way of using a fork was to grasp it daggerwise and drive it firmly
      through that skidding piece of meat. Not only this, but a cup must be held
      in one hand, and bread must be broken into little pieces before putting
      butter on it. Above all, no matter how terribly hard one tried, there was
      sure to be a mistake, and then: &ldquo;Now, Joan, don't do that. This is the way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But how different everything was in this delightful house of Daddy Dan!
    </p>
    <p>
      In an incredibly short time three torches flared about them and filled the
      air with scents of freshness and the outdoors-scents that went tingling up
      the nose and filled one with immense possibilities of eating. At the very
      same time, a few motions caused a heap of wood to catch fire and blaze
      among the stones while a steady stream of blue-white smoke wavered up
      toward the top of the cave and disappeared in the shadows. After this her
      father showed her a little stream of water which must come from a spring
      far back in the cave, and the current slipped noiselessly along one wall,
      and dipped of sight again before it reached the entrance to the place.
      Here she discovered a little bowl, made out of small stones nicely fitted
      together, and allowing the water to pour over one edge and out at another
      with a delicious purling&mdash;such crystal clear water that one actually
      wanted to wash in it even if it was cold, and even if one had the many
      sore places on fingers and nose and behind the ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold! no sooner did one turn from the washing of hands and face than the
      table was miraculously spread upon the surface of a flat rock, with other
      stones nearby to serve as chairs; and on the table steamed &ldquo;pone,&rdquo; warmed
      over; coffee with milk in it&mdash;coffee, which was so strictly banned at
      home!&mdash;potatoes sliced to transparent thinness and fried to crisp
      brown at the edges, and a great slab of meat that fairly shouted to the
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far so good, but the realization was a thousand fold better than
      anticipation. No cutting of one's own meat at this enchanted board! The
      shining knife of Daddy Dan divided it into delectable bits with the speed
      of light, and it needed only the slightest amount of experimenting and
      cautious glances to discover that one could use a fork daggerwise, and
      when in doubt even seize upon a morsel with one's fingers and wipe the
      fingers afterwards on a bit of the dry grass. One could grasp the cup by
      both sides, scorning the silly handle, and if occasionally one sipped the
      coffee with a little noise&mdash;which added astonishingly to the taste&mdash;there
      was no sharp warning, no frowning eye to overlook. Besides, at Munner's
      table, there was never time to pay attention to Joan, for there was talk
      about vague, abstract things&mdash;the price of skins, the melting of the
      snows, the condition of the passes, the long and troubling argument about
      the wicker chairs, with some remarkably foolish asides, now and then,
      concerning happiness and love&mdash;when all the time any one with half an
      eye could see that the thing to do was to eat and eat and eat until that
      hollow place ceased to be. Talking came afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house of Daddy Dan all these things were ordered as they should be.
      Not a word was said; not a glance of criticism rested upon her; when her
      tin plate was cleared she heard no reproofs for eating too greedily, but
      she was furnished anew from the store of good things on the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In place of conversation, there were other matters to occupy the mind
      during the meal. For presently she observed the beautiful head of Satan
      just behind his master&mdash;Satan, who could pass over noisy gravel with
      the softness of a cat, and now loomed out of the deeper night down the
      cavern. Inch by inch, with infinite caution and keenly pricked ears, the
      head lowered beside Dan, and the quivering, delicate muzzle stole towards
      a fragment of the &ldquo;pone.&rdquo; Joan watched breathlessly and then she saw that
      in spite of the caution of that movement her father knew all about it&mdash;just
      a glint of amusement in the corner of his eyes, just a slight twitch at
      the corners of his mouth to tell Joan that he was as delighted as a boy
      playing a trick. Barely in time to save the morsel of pone, he spoke and
      the head was dashed up. Yet Satan was not entirely discouraged. If he
      could not steal the bread he would beg for it. It made Joan pause in her
      destruction of the edibles, not to watch openly, for an instinct told her
      that the thing to do was to note these by-plays from the corner of one's
      eye, as Daddy Dan did, and swallow the ripples of mirth that came tickling
      in the throat. She knew perfectly well that Satan would have it in the
      end, for of all living things not even Munner had such power over Dan as
      the black stallion. He maneuvered adroitly. First he circled the table and
      stood opposite the master, begging with his eyes, but Dan looked fixedly
      down at the rock until an impatient whinny called up his eyes. Then he
      pretended the most absolute surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Satan, you old scoundrel, what are you doin' over there? Get back
      where you belong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gestured with a thumb over his shoulder and Satan glided around the
      rock and stood once more behind Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manners?&rdquo; continued Dan. &ldquo;You ain't got 'em. You'll be tryin' to sit down
      at the table with me, pretty soon.&rdquo; He concluded: &ldquo;But I'll teach you one
      of these days, and you'll smart for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even at the mock menace Joan trembled a little, but to her astonishment
      Satan paid not the slightest heed. Dan sat with his hat on his head&mdash;which
      was a new and delightful event at the table&mdash;and now the stallion
      took the hat by the crown, dexterously, and raised it just an inch and put
      it back in place. Black Bart, having crept out of the shadows sat down
      near Joan with his long red tongue lolling out. This procedure called a
      growl from him, but the master continued eating without the slightest
      interest, apparently, in Satan's insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A velvety muzzle appeared, with the chin resting on the shoulder of Dan
      and the great, luminous eyes above. He whinnied so softly that it was not
      more than a human whisper, and meant almost as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Dan, in all seeming just roused to attention, &ldquo;hungry, old
      boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised the morsel of &ldquo;pone&rdquo; between thumb and forefinger, holding it
      tightly. Then it was a joy to watch Satan. He tried to tug it all away at
      once, but only a fragment broke off. He stamped in impatience, and then
      went to work to nibble the bread away on all sides of Dan's fingers, very
      fine work for such broad, keen chisels as Satan's teeth, but he went about
      it with the skill of long practice, turning his head this way and that and
      always watching the face of the master with sidewise eyes, one ear forward
      and one ear back. Finally the tight fingers opened out, and Satan gathered
      the last crumbs from the smooth palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three times during this performance Black Bart had half risen from
      his haunches and a growl swelled almost inaudibly in his throat, but now
      he stalked around the table and pushed his narrow head between Dan's
      shoulder and the stallion. A snarl of incredible ferocity made Satan turn,
      but without the slightest dread, apparently. For an instant the two stood
      nose to nose, Black Bart a picture of snarling danger and Satan with
      curiously pricking ears and bright eyes. The growling rose towards a
      crescendo, a terrible sound; then a lean hand shot out with that speed
      which Joan could never comprehend&mdash;and which always made her think,
      rather breathlessly, of the strike of a snake. The fingers settled around
      the muzzle of Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all the no-good houn'-dogs,&rdquo; declared Dan, &ldquo;you're the worst, and the
      most jealousest. Lie down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bart obeyed, slowly, but his evil eyes were fixed upwards upon the head of
      Satan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you got any manners,&rdquo; remarked Dan, &ldquo;you'll be sayin' that you're
      sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ears flattened along the snaky head; otherwise no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; repeated the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the deep throat of Black Bart, infinitely, ludicrously small, came
      a whine which was more doglike than anything Joan had ever heard, before,
      from the wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued the implacable master, &ldquo;you go over in that corner, and
      lie down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Bart arose with a finally ugly look for Satan and sneaked with
      hanging head and tail to the outer edge of the circle of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farther! Clear over there in the dark,&rdquo; came the order, and Bart had to
      uncoil himself again in the very act of lying down and retreat with
      another ominous growl clear into the darkness. Satan held his head high
      and watched triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Joan felt that this was a little hard on Bart; she wanted to run over
      and comfort him, but she knew from of old that it was dangerous to
      interfere where Daddy Dan was disciplining either horse or wolf; besides,
      she was not quite free from her new awe for Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the master presently, and without raising his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It brought a dark thunder bolt rushing into the circle of the light and
      stopping at Dan's side with such suddenness that his paws slid in the
      gravel. There he stood, actually wagging his bushy tail&mdash;an
      unprecedented outburst of joy for Bart!&mdash;and staring hungrily into
      the face of Dan. She saw a wonderful softening in the eyes of her father
      as he looked at the great, dangerous beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't a bad sort,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you need puttin' in place
      continual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Bart whined agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, when the dishes were being cleared away and cleaned with a
      speed fully as marvelous as the preparation of the supper, Joan remembered
      with a guilty start the message which she should have given to Daddy Dan,
      and she brought out the paper, much rumpled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood by the fire to read the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan come back to us. The house is empty and there's no sign of you except
      your clothes and the skins you left drying in the vacant room. Joan sits
      all day, mourning for you, and my heart is breaking. Oh, Dan, I don't
      grieve so much for what has been done, but I tremble for what you may do
      in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the letter still in his hand Dan walked thoughtfully to Satan and
      took the fine head between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'pose some gent was to drop you, Satan,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;S'pose he was to
      plug you while you was doin' your best to take me where I want to go.
      S'pose he shot you not for anything you'd done but because of something
      agin me. And s'pose after killin' you he was to sneak up on me with a lot
      of other gents and try to murder me before I had a chance to fight back.
      Satan, wouldn't I be right to trail 'em all&mdash;and kill 'em one by one?
      Wouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joan heard very little of the words&mdash;only a soft murmur of anxiety,
      and she saw that Daddy Dan was very thoughtful indeed. The stallion
      reached for the brim of Dan's hat&mdash;it was withdrawn from his reach&mdash;his
      head bowed, like a nod of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, even Satan can see I'm right,&rdquo; murmured Dan, and moving back to the
      fire, he tore the letter into many pieces which fluttered down in a white
      stream and made the blaze leap up.

    <p>
      Mrs. Johnny Sommers managed to preserve her dignity while she escorted the
      visitor into the front room, and even while she asked him to sit down and
      wait, but once she had closed the door behind her she cast dignity far
      away and did two steps at a time going upstairs. The result was that she,
      reached the room of Betty Neal entirely out of breath; two hundred pounds
      of fat, good-natured widowhood do not go with speed. She tossed open the
      door without any preliminary knock and stood there very red with a clearly
      defined circle of white in the center of each check. For a moment there
      was no sound except her panting and Betty Neal stared wildly at her from
      above her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's come!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Sommers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if this odd explanation made everything clear, Betty Neal sprang from
      her chair and she grew so pale that every freckle stood out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him!&rdquo; she echoed ungrammatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: &ldquo;Where is he? Let me downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the widow closed the door swiftly behind her and leaned her
      comfortable bulk against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't goin',&rdquo; she asserted. &ldquo;You ain't goin', leastways not till you
      got time to think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't time to think. I&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the way with me,&rdquo; nodded Mrs. Sommers, and her eyes were tragic.
      &ldquo;I went ahead and married Johnny in spite of everything, and look at me
      now&mdash;a widder! No, I ain't sorry for myself because I was a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Sommers,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;will you please step out of my way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honey, for heaven's sake think a minute before you go down and face that
      man. He's dangerous. When I opened the door and seen him, I tell you the
      shivers went up my back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he thin? Is he pale?&rdquo; cried Betty Neal. &ldquo;How did he get away? Did he
      escape? Did they parole him? Did they pardon him? Did he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get down!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sommers flung away from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go and marry your man-killer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Betty Neal was already clattering down the stairs. Half way to the
      bottom her strength and courage ebbed suddenly from her; she went on with
      short steps, and when at last she closed the parlor door behind her, she
      was staring as if she looked at a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Vic Gregg was not greatly changed&mdash;a little thinner perhaps, and
      just now he certainly did not have his usual color. The moment she
      appeared he jumped to his feet as if he had heard a shot, and now he stood
      with his feet braced a little to meet a shock, one hand twitching and
      playing nervously with the embroidered cloth on the table. She did not
      speak; merely stood with her fingers still gripping the handle of the door
      as if she were ready to dart away at the first alarm. A wave of pain went
      over the face of Vic Gregg and remained looking at her out of his eyes,
      for all that his single-track, concentrated mind could perceive in her was
      the thing he took for fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Neal,&rdquo; he said. His voice shook, straightened out again. He made her
      think of one of her big school boys who had forgotten his lesson and now
      stood cudgeling his memory and dreading that terrible nightmare of
      &ldquo;staying after school.&rdquo; She had a wild desire to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Neal, I ain't here to try to take up things that can't be took up
      ag'in.&rdquo; Apparently he had prepared the speech carefully, and now he went
      on with more ease: &ldquo;I'm leavin' these here parts for some place unknown.
      Before I go I jest want to say I know I was wrong from the beginnin'. All
      I want to say is that I was jest all sort of tied up in a knot inside and
      when I seen you with him&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped. &ldquo;I hope you marry some gent
      that's worth you, only they ain't any such. An'&mdash;I want to wish you
      good-luck, an' say good-by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swept the perspiration from his forehead, and caught up his hat; he had
      been through the seventh circle of torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Vic, dear!&rdquo; cried a voice he had never heard before. Then a flurry of
      skirts, then arms about him, then tears and laughter, and eyes which went
      hungrily over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I been a houn'-dog. My God, Betty, you don't mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I love you, Vic. I never knew what it was to love you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After I been a man-killin', lyin', sneakin'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you say another word. Vic, it was all my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't. It was mine. But if you'd only kind of held off a little and
      gone easy with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't give me a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I looked back from the road you wasn't standin' in the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was. And you didn't look back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic Gregg, are you trying to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the anger fled from her as suddenly as it had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care. I'll take all the blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want you to. I won't let you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic, tell me that you're free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm paroled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! Oh, I've prayed and prayed&mdash;Vic, don't talk. Sit down
      there&mdash;so! I just want to look and look at you. There's a hollow,
      hungry place in me that's filling up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Pete Glass,&rdquo; said Gregg brokenly. &ldquo;He&mdash;he trusted me clean
      through when the rest was lookin' at me like I was a snake. Pete got word
      to the governor, an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a long interval of talk that meant nothing, and then, as
      the afternoon waned towards evening, and the evening toward dark, he told
      her the whole story of the long adventure. He left out nothing, not a
      detail that might tell against him. When he came to the moment when Glass
      persuaded him to go back and betray Barry he winced, but set his jaw and
      plunged ahead. She, too, paled when she heard that, and for a moment she
      had to cover her eyes, but she was older by half a life-time than she had
      been when he was last with her, and now she read below the surface.
      Besides, Vic had offered to undo what he had done, had offered to stay and
      fight for Barry, and surely that evened the score!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a light rap on the door, and then Mrs. Sommers came in with a
      tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you young folks forgot about supper,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just thought I'd
      bring in a bite for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She placed it on the table, and then lingered, delighted, while her eyes
      went over them together and one by one. Perhaps Betty Neal was a fool for
      throwing herself away on a gun-fighter, but at least Mrs. Sommers was
      furnished with a story which half Alder would know by tomorrow. The walls
      of her house were not sound proof. Besides, Mrs. Sommers had remarkably
      keen ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They's been a gentleman here ask for you, Vic,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I thought
      maybe you wouldn't like it much to be disturbed. So I told him you wasn't
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her smile fairly glowed with triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Gregg, &ldquo;but who was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never seen him before. Anyway, it didn't much matter. He wanted to see
      some of the rest of the boys quite bad: Pete Glass and Ronicky Joe, and
      Sliver Waldron, and Gus Reeve. He seemed to want to see 'em all particular
      bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete Glass and Ronicky and&mdash;the posse!&rdquo; murmured Vic. He grew
      thoughtful. &ldquo;He wanted to see me, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very particular, and he seemed kind of down-hearted when he found that
      Pete was out of town. Wanted to know when he might be back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a lookin' gent was he?&rdquo; asked Vic, and his voice was sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him? Oh, he looked like a tenderfoot to me. Terrible polite, though, and
      he had a voice that wasn't hardly rougher'n a girl's. Seemed like he was
      sort of embarrassed jest talkin' to me.&rdquo; She smiled at the thought, but
      Gregg was on his feet now, his hands on the shoulders of Mrs. Sommers as
      though he would try to shake information from her loose bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look quick, now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where did you send him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you talk! Why, where should I send him? I told him like as not
      Ronicky and Sliver and Gus would be down to Lorrimer's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The groan of Vic made her stop with a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sommers was very sober. Her smile congealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black hair, and young, and good-lookin', and b-b-brown eyes, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic,&rdquo; cried Betty Neal, &ldquo;what is it!&rdquo; She looked around her in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Barry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards the door, and then stopped, in an agony of indecision.
      Betty Neal was before him, blocking the way with her arms outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic, you shan't go. You shan't go. You've told me yourself that he's sure
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't go, Vic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the others! Ronicky&mdash;Gus&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stammered in her fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's their lookout! They're three to one. Let them kill&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they don't know him. They've never been close enough to see his face.
      Besides, no three men I&mdash;he&mdash;for God's sake tell me what to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here&mdash;if you love me. I won't let you go. I won't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got to warn them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tore away her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got to warn them&mdash;but who'll I help? Them three against Dan? He
      saved me&mdash;twice! But&mdash;I got. I got to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you fight for him first he'll only turn on you afterwards. Vic, stay
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good's my life? What good's it if I'm a yaller dog ag'in? I'm goin'
      out&mdash;and be a man!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XXII. The Fifth Man
    </h2>
    <p>
      The moment Vic Gregg stood in the open air, with the last appeal of Betty
      ringing still at his ear, he felt a profound conviction that he was about
      to die and he stood a moment breathing deeply, taking the faint alkali
      scent of the dust and looking up to the stars. It was that moment when
      night blends with day and there is no sign of light in the sky except that
      the stars burn more and more bright as the darkness thickens, and Vic
      Gregg watched the stars draw down more closely and believed that he was
      seeing this for the last time. Alder seemed inexpressibly dear to him as
      he stood there through a little space, and the vaguely discernible
      outlines of the shacks along the street were like the faces of friends. In
      that house behind him was Betty Neal, waiting, praying for him, and
      indeed, had it not been for shame, he would have weakened now and turned
      back. For he hardly knew which way to turn. He wanted to save Ronicky and
      the other two from the attack of Barry, yet he would not lay a trap for
      Dan. To Barry he owed a vast debt; his debt to the three was that which
      any human being owes to another. He had to save them from the wolf which
      ran through the night in the body of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That thought sent him at a run for Captain Lorrimer's saloon. It was
      lighted brilliantly by the gasoline lamp within, but a short distance away
      from it he heard no sound and his imagination drew a terrible picture of
      the big, empty room, with three dead men lying in the center of it where
      the destroyer had reached them one by one. That was what took the blood
      from his face and made him a white mask of tragedy when he stepped into
      the door of the saloon. It was quiet, but half a dozen men sat at the
      tables in the corner, and among them were Ronicky and the other two.
      Sliver Waldron was in the very act of pulling back his chair, and perhaps
      all three had just come in. Perhaps Barry had come here to look for his
      quarry and found them not yet arrived; perhaps he was now hunting in other
      places through the town; perhaps he was even now crouched in the shadow
      near at hand and ready to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made the hand of Vic Gregg contract with a cruel pressure when it fell
      on the shoulder of Sliver Waldron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what in hell!&rdquo; grunted that hardened warrior.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no love for Vic Gregg since that day when the posse rode through
      the hills after him; neither had Ronicky or Gus Reeve, who rose from their
      chairs as if at a signal. &ldquo;Come with me, gents,&rdquo; said Vic. &ldquo;An' come
      quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They asked no questions and did not stay to argue the point for he had
      that in his face which meant action. He led them outside, and behind the
      horse shed of the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're alone?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin' in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They peered about them through the night, and a wan moon only helped to
      make the darkness visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gents, we may be alone now, but we ain't goin' to be alone long. Get your
      hosses and ride like hell. Barry is in town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic, you're drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, he's been seen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then by God,&rdquo; growled Sliver Waldron, &ldquo;lead me to him. I need to have a
      little talk with that gent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead you to him?&rdquo; echoed Vic Gregg. &ldquo;Sliver, are you hungerin' to push
      daisies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Bud,&rdquo; answered the older man, and he laid a hand on the
      shoulder of Vic. &ldquo;You been with this Barry, gent, and you've lived in his
      house. D'you mean to say you're one of the lot that talks about him like
      he was a ghost bullets couldn't harm? I tell you, son, they's been so much
      chatter about him that folks forget he's human. I'm goin' to remind 'em of
      that little fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vic Gregg groaned. Even while he talked he was glancing over his shoulder
      as if he feared the shadows under the moon. His voice was half gasp, half
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sliver&mdash;Ronicky&mdash;don't ask me how I know&mdash;jest believe me
      when I say Dan Barry'll never die by the hand of any man. I tell you&mdash;he
      can see in the dark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A soft oath from Gus Reeve; a twitching of Ronicky's head told that this
      last had taken effect. Sliver Waldron suddenly altered his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Vic. Trot back into town, or come with us. We're going to move
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wisest thing you ever done, Sliver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm feelin' the same way,&rdquo; breathed Gus Reeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'long,&rdquo; whispered Vic Gregg, and faded into the night, running.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others, without a word among themselves, gathered their horses and
      struck down the valley out of Alder. The padding and swish of the sand
      about the feet of their mounts; the very creaking of the saddle leather
      seemed to alarm them, and they were continually turning and looking back.
      That is, Gus Reeve and Ronicky Joe manifested these signs of trouble, but
      Sliver Waldron, riding in the center of the trio, never moved his head.
      They were hardly well out of the town when a swift rush of hoof beats
      swept up from behind, and a horseman darted into the pale mist of the
      valley bending low over his pommel to cut the wind of his riding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vic Gregg!&rdquo; muttered Gus Reeve. &ldquo;Stir, along, Sliver. Vic ain't lingerin'
      any!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sliver Waldron drew rein, and let his horse go on at a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearin' you talk, Ronicky,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you'd think you was really scared
      of Dan Barry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ronicky Joe stiffened in his saddle and peered through the uncertain light
      to make out if Sliver were jesting. But the latter seemed perfectly grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gent would almost think,&rdquo; went on Sliver, &ldquo;that we three was runnin'
      away from Barry, instead of goin' out to set a trap for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something nearly akin to a grunt from Gus Reeve, but Ronicky
      merely continued to stare at the leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'S a matter of fact,&rdquo; said Sliver, &ldquo;when Vic was talkin' I sort of felt
      the chills go up my back. How about you, Ronicky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell a man,&rdquo; sighed Ronicky. &ldquo;While Vic was talkin' I seen that
      devil comin' on his hoss like he done when he broke out of the cabin that
      night. I'll tell you straight, Sliver. I had my gun drilled on him. I
      couldn't of missed; but after I fired he kept straight on. It was like
      puncturin' a shadow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; nodded Sliver. &ldquo;Shootin' by night ain't ever a sure thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ronicky wiped his heated brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I sent Vic away before he had a chance to get real nervous. But when
      he comes back&mdash;well, boys, it'll be kind of amusin' to watch Vic's
      face when he saunters into town tomorrow and sees Dan Barry&mdash;maybe
      dead, maybe in the irons. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only a deep silence answered him, but in the interest which his words
      excited the terror seemed to have left Ronicky and Gus. They rode close,
      their heads toward Sliver alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes Vic,&rdquo; mused Sliver. &ldquo;There he goes&mdash;go on. Mac, you old
      fool!&mdash;scared to death, ridin' for his life. And why? Because he
      believes some ghost stories he's heard about Dan Barry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghost stories?&rdquo; echoed Reeve. &ldquo;Some of 'em ain't fairy tales, Sliver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest name one that ain't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the way he trailed Jim Silent. We've all heard of Silent, and Barry&mdash;was
      too good for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; sneered Sliver. &ldquo;Too good for Silent? Ye lied readily enough: booze
      done for Silent long before Barry come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell a man it is. Mind you, I don't say Barry ain't handy with his
      gun; but he's done a little and the gents have furnished the trimmin's.
      Look here, if Barry is the man-eater they say, why did he pick a time for
      comin' down when the sheriff was out of town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; exclaimed Ronicky. &ldquo;I never thought of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure you didn't,&rdquo; chuckled Sliver. &ldquo;But this sucker figures that you and
      Gus and me will be easy pickin's. He figures we'll do what Vic did&mdash;hit
      for the tall pines. Then he'll blow around how he ran the four of us out
      of Alder. Be pleasant comin' back to talk like that, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a volley of rapid curses from the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get this cheap skate, Sliver,&rdquo; suggested Ronicky. &ldquo;We'll get this
      ghost and tie him up and take him back to Alder and make a show of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will,&rdquo; nodded Sliver. &ldquo;Have you figured how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie out here in the bush. He'll hunt around Alder all night and when the
      mornin' comes he'll leave and he'll come out this way. We'll be ready for
      him where the valley's narrow down there. They say his hoss and his dog is
      as bad as any two ordinary men. Well, that's three of them and here's
      three of us. It's an even break, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ronicky,&rdquo; murmured Sliver, &ldquo;I always knowed you had the brains. We'll
      take this gent and tame him, and run him back to Alder on the end of a
      rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gus Reeve whooped and waved his hat at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the three reached the point where the shadowy walls of the valley
      narrowed, drew almost together. There they placed the horses in a hollow
      near the southern cliff, and they returned to take post. There was only
      one bridle path which wound through the gulch here, and the three
      concealed themselves behind a thicket of sagebrush to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      They laid their plan carefully. Each man was to have his peculiar duty:
      Gus Reeve, an adept with the rope, would wait until the black stallion was
      cantering past and then toss his noose and throw the horse. At the same
      instant, Ronicky Joe would shoot the wolf-dog, and Sliver Waldron would
      perforate Dan Barry while the latter rolled in the dust, unless, indeed,
      he was pinioned by the fall of his horse, in which case they would have
      the added glory of taking him alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time all these details were settled the pale moonlight was shot
      through with the rose of dawn. Then, rapidly, the mountains lifted into
      view, range beyond range, all their gullies deep blue and purple, and here
      and there sharp triangles of snow. There was not a cloud, not a trace of
      mist, and through the crisp, thin air the vision carried as if through a
      telescope. They could count the trees on the upper ridges; and that while
      the floor of the valley was still in shadow. This in turn grew brilliant,
      and everywhere the sage brush glittered like foliage carved in gray-green
      quartz.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that they saw Dan Barry, while the dawn was still around them,
      and before the sun pushed up in the east above the mountains. He came
      winding down the bridle path with the dawn glittering on the side of
      Satan, and a dark, swift form spiriting on ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at him!&rdquo; muttered Sliver Waldron. &ldquo;The damned wolf is a scout. See
      him nose around that hummock? Watch him smell behind that bush. The black
      devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bart, in fact, wove a loose course before his master, running here and
      there to all points of vantage, as if he knew that danger lurked ahead,
      but where he came close, with only the narrow passage between the cliffs,
      he seemed to make up his animal brain that there could be no trouble in so
      constricted a place, and darted straight ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're ours,&rdquo; whispered Waldron. &ldquo;Steady, boys. Gus, get your rope, get
      ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gus tossed the noose a little wider, and gathered himself for the throw,
      but it seemed as if the wolf saw or heard the movement. He stopped
      suddenly and stood with his head high; behind him the rider checked the
      black horse; all three waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's tryin' to get the wind,&rdquo; chuckled Waldron, &ldquo;but the wind is ag'in'
      our faces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only a slight breeze, but it came directly against the lurking
      three; and moreover the scent of the sage was particularly keen at this
      time of the day, and quite sufficient to blur the scent of man even in the
      keen nostrils of Black Bart. Only for a second or so he stood there
      sniffing the wind, a huge animal, larger than any wolf the three had ever
      seen; his face wise in a certain bear-like fashion from the three gray
      marks in the center of his forehead. Now he trotted ahead, and the
      stallion broke into a gallop behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; whispered Sliver to Gus, &ldquo;don't spoil that hoss when you daub
      the rope on him! Look at that action; like runnin' water!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came more rapidly. As if the rider knew that a point of danger was
      there to be passed, he spoke to his mount, and Satan lengthened into a
      racing gait that blew the brim of the rider's hat straight up. On they
      came. The wolf-dog darted past. Then as the horse swept by, Gus Reeve rose
      from behind his bush and the rope darted snakelike from his hand. The
      forefeet of Satan landed in the noose, and the next instant the back-flung
      weight of Gus tightened the rope, and Satan shot over upon his side,
      flinging the master clear of the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sent him rolling over and over in the dust, and Sliver Waldron was on
      his feet with both guns in action, sending bullet after bullet towards the
      tumbling body. Gus Reeve was running towards the stallion, his rope in
      action to entangle one of the hindfeet and make sure of his prey; Ronicky
      Joe had leaped up with a yell and blazed away at Black Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no easy mark to strike, for the moment the rope shot out from the
      hand of Gus, the wolf-dog whirled in his tracks and darted straight for
      the scene of action. It was that, perhaps, which troubled the aim of
      Ronicky more than anything else, for wild animals do not whirl in this
      fashion and run for an assailant. He had expected to find himself plugging
      away at a flying target in the distance; instead, the black monster was
      rushing straight for him, silently. Indeed, all that followed was in
      silence after that first wild Indian yell from Ronicky Joe. His gun
      barked, but Black Bart was running like a football player down a broken
      field, swerving here and there with uncanny speed. Again, again, Joe
      missed, and then flung up his arm toward the flying danger. But Black Bart
      shot from the ground to make his kill. He could bring down the strongest
      bull in the herd. What was the arm of a man to him? His snake-like head
      shot through that futile guard; his teeth cut off the screams of Ronicky
      Joe. Down they went. The gun flew from the hand of Ronicky; for an instant
      he struggled with hands and writhing legs, and then the murderous teeth of
      Bart sank deeper, found the life. The dead body was limp, but Bart,
      shaking his hold deeper to make sure, glared across to the fallen master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third man had died for Grey Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had happened in a second, and the body of Barry was still rolling
      when a gun flashed in his hand, drawn while he tumbled. It spat fire, and
      Sliver Waldron staggered forward drunkenly, waved both his armed hands as
      if he were trying to talk by signal, and pitched on his face into the
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth man had died for Grey Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      No gun was destined for Gus Reeve, however. Black Bart had left the
      lifeless body of his victim and was darting towards the third man; the
      master was on his knee, raising his gun for the last shot; but Gus Reeve
      was blind to all that had happened. He saw only the black stallion, the
      matchless prize of horseflesh. He tossed a loop in the taut rope to
      entangle a bind foot, but that slackening of the line gave Satan his
      instant's purchase, and a moment later he was on his feet, whirled, and
      two iron-hard hoofs crushed the whole framework of the man's chest like an
      egg-shell. The impact lifted him from his feet, but before that body
      struck the ground the life was fled from it. The fifth man had died for
      Grey Molly.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIII. Bad News
    </h2>
    <p>
      News of the Killing at Alder, as they call that night's slaughter to this
      day in the mountain-desert, traveled swiftly, and lost nothing of bulk and
      burden on the way; so that two days later, when Lee Haines went down for
      mail to the wretched little village in the valley, he heard the
      store-keeper retailing the story to an awe-stricken group. How the tale
      had crossed all the wild mountains which lay between in so brief a space
      no man could say, but first there ran a whisper and then a stir, and then
      half a dozen men came in at once, each with an elaboration of the theme
      more horrible than the last. The store-keeper culled the choicest
      fragments from every version, strung them together with a narrative of his
      own fertile invention, polished off the tale by a few rehearsals in his
      home, and then placed his product on the open market. The very first day
      he kept the store-room well filled from dawn until dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was the creation to which Lee Haines had to listen, impatient,
      sifting the chaff from the grains of truth. Down upon Alder, exactly at
      midnight, had ridden a cavalcade headed by that notorious, half-legendary
      man-slayer, Dan Barry&mdash;Whistling Dan. While his crew of two-score
      hardened ruffians held the doors and the windows with leveled rifles,
      Barry had entered with a gun and a wolf&mdash;a wild wolf, and had
      butchered ten men, wantonly. To add to the mystery, there was no motive of
      robbery for the crime. One sweeping visitation of death, and then the
      night-riders had rushed away. Nor was this all, for Sheriff Pete Glass,
      hearing of the tragedy, had ridden to Rickett, the county seat, and from
      this strategic point of vantage he was sending out a call for the most
      practised fighters on the mountain-desert. He wanted twenty men proved
      beyond the shadow of question for courage, endurance, speed, and surety in
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; concluded the store-keeper, fixing his eye upon Lee Haines, &ldquo;if you
      want a long ride free of charge, and ten bucks a day with chow thrown in&mdash;some
      of you gents ought to go to Rickett and chin with Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haines waited to hear no more. He even forgot to ask for the Barry mail,
      swung into his saddle, and rode with red spurs back to the cabin in the
      mountains. There he drew Buck Daniels aside, and they walked among the
      rocks while Haines told his story. When it was ended they sat on adjoining
      boulders and chucked pebbles aimlessly into the emptiness beyond the
      cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Buck suddenly, &ldquo;it wasn't Dan at all. He sure wouldn't be
      ridin' with no crowd of gents like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fool like that store-keeper could make a crowd of Indians out of one
      papoose,&rdquo; answered Haines. &ldquo;It was Dan. Who else would be traipsing around
      with a dog that looks like a wolf&mdash;and hunts men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember when Dan cornered Jim Silent in that cabin, and all Jim's gang
      was with him. Black Bart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buck,&rdquo; cut in Haines, &ldquo;you've remembered plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment: &ldquo;When are you going in to break the news to Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buck Daniels regarded him with angry astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I'd sooner cut my tongue out!&rdquo; He drew a great breath. &ldquo;I
      feel like&mdash;like Dan was dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing for Kate if he were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a queer thing to say, Lee. The meat would be rotted off your bones
      six years ago in Elkhead if it hadn't been for Whistlin' Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Buck. But I'll tell you straight that I could never feel
      towards Dan as if he were a human being, but a wolf in the hide of a man.
      He turned my blood cold; he always has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buck Daniels groaned aloud as thoughts poured back on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all the pals that ever a man had,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;there never was a
      partner like Whistlin' Dan. There was never another gent that would go
      through hell for you jest because you'd eaten meat with him. The first
      time I met him I tried to double-cross him, because I had my orders from
      Silent. And Dan played clean with me&mdash;by God, he shook hands with me
      when he left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He straightened a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me God, Lee, I've never done a crooked thing more since I shook
      hands with Dan that day.&rdquo; He sat silent, but breathing hard. &ldquo;Well, this
      is the end of Whistlin' Dan. The law will never let up on him now; but I
      tell you, Haines, I'm sick inside and I'd give my right hand plumb to the
      wrist to set him straight and bring him back to Kate. Go in and tell her,
      Lee. I&mdash;I'll wait for you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be damned,&rdquo; cried Haines. &ldquo;I've done my share by bringing the word
      this far. You can relay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buck Daniels produced a silver dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heads or tails?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heads!&rdquo; said Haines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dollar spun upwards, winking, and clanked on the rocks, tails up.
      Haines stared at it with a grisly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;what'll I do, Buck, if she faints?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faints?&rdquo; echoed Daniels, &ldquo;there's no fear of that! The first thing you'll
      have to do is to saddle her horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what in hell are you driving at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be thinkin' of Joan. God knows she worried enough because Dan
      hasn't brought the kid back before this, but when she hears what he's done
      now, she'll know that he's wild for keeps and she'll be on the trail to
      bring the young'un home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his back cleanly on the house and set his shoulders tense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Lee. Be a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard the steps of Haines start briskly enough for the house, but they
      trailed away, slowly and more slowly, and finally there was a long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's standing at the door,&rdquo; muttered Buck. &ldquo;Thank God I ain't in his
      boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jerked out his papers and tobacco, but in the very act of twisting the
      cigarette tight the door slammed and he ripped the flimsy thing in two. He
      started to take another paper, but his fingers were so unsteady that he
      could not pull away the single sheet of tissue which he wanted. Then his
      hands froze in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint tapping came out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he's rapping on her door,&rdquo; whispered Buck, and remained fixed in
      place, his eyes staring straight before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seconds slipped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's turned yaller,&rdquo; murmured Buck. &ldquo;He couldn't do it. It'll be up to
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had hardly spoken the words when a low cry came out to him from the
      house. Then the silence again, but Buck Daniels began to mop his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, once, twice, and again he made the effort to turn towards the
      house, but when he finally succeeded it was whole minutes later, and Lee
      Haines was leading a saddled horse from the coral. Kate stood beside the
      cabin, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached her, she was already mounted. He halted beside her,
      panting, his hand on her bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't do it, Kate!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Lemme go with you. Lemme go and try to
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brisk wind up the gulch set her clothes fluttering, stirred the hair
      about the rim of her hat, and she seemed to Buck more gracefully, more
      beautifully young than he had ever seen her; but her face was like stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd be no help,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;When I get to the place I may have to
      meet him! Would you face him, Buck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand fell away from the bridle. It was not so much what she said as
      the cold, steady voice with which she spoke that unnerved him. Then,
      without a farewell, she turned the brown horse around and struck across
      the meadow at a swift gallop. Buck turned to meet the sick face of Haines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have that flask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buck produced a metal &ldquo;life-saver,&rdquo; and Haines with nervous hands
      unscrewed the top and lifted it to his lips. He lowered it after a long
      moment and stood bracing himself against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was hell, Buck. God help me if I ever have to go through a thing like
      that again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you done,&rdquo; said Buck angrily. &ldquo;You walked right in and took
      your story in both hands and knocked her down with it. Haines, of all the
      ornery, thick-headed cayuses I ever see, you're the most out-beatin'est!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I went in she took one look at me and then jumped up and stood as
      straight as a pine tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Lee,' she said, 'what have you heard?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'About what?' I asked her, and I looked sort of indifferent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; snorted Buck. &ldquo;She could see death an' hell written all over your
      face, most like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; muttered Haines, &ldquo;I&mdash;I was sick!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tell me!' she said, coming close up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He's gone wild again,' was all I could put my tongue to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I blurted it out. I had to get rid of the damned story some way, and
      the quickest way seemed the best&mdash;how Dan rode into Alder and did the
      killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I got to that she gave one cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Buck, shuddering. &ldquo;Like something dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she asked me to saddle her horse. I begged her to let me go with
      her, and she said to me what she just now said to you. And so I stayed.
      What good could we do against that devil?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIV. The Music
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the last ravine Kate's horse carried her easily enough, but that
      mountain pass was impenetrable through all its length to anything except
      the uncanny agility of Satan, and so she left the cow-pony in the bottom
      of the gorge and climbed the last rise on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the mountainside above her, it was not easy to locate the cave, for the
      slope was clawed into ravines and confused with meaningless criss-cross
      gulches. Whatever scrub evergreens grew there stood under the shade of
      boulders which threatened each instant to topple over and go thundering to
      the base. She had come upon the cave by chance in her ride with Dan, and
      now she hunted vainly through the great stones for the entrance. A fresh
      wind, chill with the snows of the upper peaks, pulled and tugged at her
      and cut her face and hands with flying bits of sand. It kept up a
      whistling so insistent that it was some time before she recognized in the
      hum of the gale a different note, not of pleasant music, but a thin,
      shrill sound that blended with the voice of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant she heard it she stopped short on the lee side of a tall rock
      and looked about her in terror. The mountains walked away on every side,
      and those resolute masses gave her courage. She listened, for the big rock
      cut away the breath of the wind about her ears and she could make out the
      whistling more clearly. It was a strain as delicate as a pin point ray of
      light in a dark room, but it made Kate tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the sound ended she stayed there by the rock, hearkening, but the
      moment it ceased she gathered her resolution with a great effort and went
      straight toward the source of the whistling. It was only a moment away,
      although the wind had made it seem much farther, and she came on the tall,
      narrow opening with Joan sitting on a rock just within. Instead of the
      blue cloak, she was wrapped in a tawny hide, and the yellow hair blew this
      way and that, unsheltered from the wind. The loneliness of the little
      figure made Kate's heart ache, made her pause on her way, and while she
      hesitated, Joan's head rested back against the rock, her eyes half closed,
      her lips pursed, she began to whistle that same keen, eerie music.
    </p>
    <p>
      It brought Kate to her in a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Joan!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;My baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she would have swept the child into her arms, but Joan slipped out
      from under her very fingers and stood a little distance off with her hands
      pressed against the wall on either side of her, ready to dart one way or
      the other. It was not sudden terror, but rather a resolute determination
      to struggle against capture to the end, and her blue eyes were blazing
      with excitement. Kate was on her knees with her arms held out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan, dear, have you forgotten munner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wildness flickered away from the eyes of the child little by little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner?&rdquo; she repeated dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      No shout of welcome, no sudden rush, no arms to fling about her mother.
      But if her throat was dry and closed Kate allowed no sign of it to creep
      into her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Daddy Dan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;over there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother rose slowly to her feet, and looked out across the mountains as
      if in search of aid. For her mind had harked back to that story her father
      used to tell of the coming of Dan Barry; how he had ridden across the
      hills one evening and saw, walking against the sunset, a tattered boy who
      whistled strangely as he went, and when old Joe Cumberland asked where he
      was going he had only waved a vague hand toward the north and answered,
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;over there. It was sufficient destination for him, it was
      sufficient explanation now for the child. She remembered how she, herself
      a child then, had sat at her father's table and watched the brown face of
      the strange boy with fascination, and the wild, quick eyes which went
      everywhere and rested in no one place. They were the eyes which looked up
      to her now from Joan's face, and she felt suddenly divorced from her baby,
      as if all the blood in Joan were the blood of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left you here alone?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child looked at her with a sort of curious amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan isn't alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She whistled softly, and around the corner of the rock peered two tiny,
      beady-bright eyes, and the sharp nose of a coyote puppy. It disappeared at
      once at the sight of the stranger, and now all the strength went from
      Kate. She slipped helplessly down, and sat on a boulder trying to think,
      trying to master the panic which chilled her; for she thought of the day
      when Whistling Dan brought home to the Cumberland Ranch the wounded
      wolf-dog, Black Bart. But the call of Joan had traveled far, and now a
      squirrel came in at a gallop with his vast tail bobbing behind him, and
      ran right up the rock until he was on the shoulder of the child. From this
      point of vantage, however, he saw Kate, and was instantly on the floor of
      the cave and scurrying for the entrance, chattering with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild things came to Joan as they came to her father, and the eyes of
      the child were the eyes of Dan Barry. It came home to Kate and she saw the
      truth for the first time in her life. She had struggled to win him away
      from his former life, but now she knew that it was not habit which
      controlled him, for he was wild by instinct, by nature. Just as the tang
      of his untamed blood had turned the child to this; and a few days more of
      life with him would leave her wild forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left you alone here!&rdquo; she repeated fiercely. &ldquo;Where a thousand things
      might happen. Thank God I've found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even if her words conveyed little meaning to Joan, the intonation carried
      a message which was perfectly clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you like Daddy Dan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan, Joan, I love him! Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Joan sat with a dubious eye which quickly darkened into fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Munner, don't take us back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such horror and terror and sadness mixed! The tears rushed into the eyes
      of Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to stay here, sweetheart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, munner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first Joan shook her head decidedly, but thereafter she quickly became
      thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, except when we eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want me here at dinner-time? Poor munner will get so hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great concession was about to burst from the remorseful lips of Joan,
      but again second thought sobered her. She remained in a quandary, unable
      to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you want me even when you wake up at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you're so afraid of the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan's not afraid. Oh, no! Joan loves the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Kate maintained a smile, it was a frozen grimace. It had only been a
      few days&mdash;hardly yesterday&mdash;that Joan left, and already she was
      a little stranger. Suppose Dan should refuse to come back himself; refuse
      even to give up Joan! She started up, clutching the hand of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Joan, we must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan doesn't want to go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll go&mdash;for a little walk. We&mdash;we'll surprise Daddy Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Daddy Dan won't come back for long, long time. Not till the sun is
      away down behind that hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That should mean two hours, at least, thought Kate. She could wait a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan, what taught you not to be afraid of the dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This problem made Joan look about for an answer, but at length she called
      softly: &ldquo;Jackie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited, and then whistled; at once the bright eyes of the little
      coyote appeared around the edge of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slunk out with his head turned towards Kate and cowered at the feet of
      the child. And the mother cringed inwardly at the sight; all wild things
      which hated man instinctively with tooth and claw were the friends, the
      allies of Whistling Dan, and now Joan was stepping in her father's path. A
      little while longer and the last vestige of gentleness would pass from
      her. She would be like Dan Barry, following calls which no other human
      could even hear. It meant one thing: at whatever cost, Joan must be taken
      from Dan and kept Away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jackie sleeps near me,&rdquo; Joan was saying. &ldquo;We can see in the dark, can't
      we, Jackie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her head, and the moment her compelling eyes left him, Jackie
      scooted for shelter. The first strangeness had worn away from Joan and she
      began to chatter away about life in the cave, and how Satan played there
      by the firelight with Black Bart, and how, sometimes&mdash;wonderful
      sight!&mdash;Daddy Dan played with them. The recital was quite endless, as
      they pushed farther and farther into the shadows, and it was the
      uneasiness which the dim light raised in her that made Kate determine that
      the time had come to go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we're going for that walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not away down there!&rdquo; cried Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's lots nicer here, munner. You'd ought to just see what we have to
      eat! And my, Daddy Dan knows how to fix things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he does. Now put on your hat and your cloak, Joan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is lots warmer, munner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you like it?&rdquo; she added in alarm, stroking the delicate fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate ripped away the fastenings and tossed the skin far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; breathed Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't clean! It isn't clean,&rdquo; cried Kate. &ldquo;Oh, my poor, darling baby!
      Get your bonnet and your cloak, Joan, quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're coming back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joan trudged obediently to the side of the cave and produced both
      articles, sadly rumpled, and Kate buttoned her into them with trembling
      fingers. Something akin to cold made her shake now. It was very much like
      a child's fear of the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she turned towards the entrance to the cave and caught the hand of
      Joan, the child wrenched herself free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll never come back,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;Munner, I won't go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan, come to me this instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grief and fear and defiance had set the child trembling, but what the
      mother saw was the glint of the eyes, uneasy, hunting escape with animal
      cunning. It turned her heart cold, and she knew, with a sad, full
      knowledge that Dan was lost forever and that only one power could save
      Joan. That power was herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A resolute silence answered her, and when she went threateningly forward,
      Joan shrank into the shadows near the rock. It was the play of light
      striking slantwise from the entrance, no doubt, but it seemed to Kate that
      a flicker of yellow light danced across the eyes of the child. And it
      stopped Kate took her breath with a new terror. Dan Barry, in the old
      days, had lived a life as quiet as a summer's day until the time Jim
      Silent struck him down in the saloon; and she remembered how Black Bart
      had come for her and led her to the saloon, and how she found Dan lying on
      the floor, streaked with blood, very pale; and how she had kneeled by him
      in a panic, and how his eyes had opened and stared at her without answer
      and the yellow, inhuman light swirled in them until she rose and backed
      out the door and fled in a hysteria of fear up the road. That had been the
      beginning of the end for Dan Barry, that instant when his eyes changed;
      and now Joan&mdash;she ran at her swiftly and gathered her into her arms.
      One instant of wild struggling, and then the child lay still, her head
      straightened a little, a shrill whistle pealed through the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate stopped that piercing call with her hand, but when she turned, she
      saw in the entrance the dark body of Bart and his narrow, snake-like head.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXV. The Battle
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;It's Dan,&rdquo; whispered Kate. &ldquo;He's come.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe Daddy Dan sent Bart back alone, munner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he do that often? Come quickly, Joan. Run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran towards the entrance, stumbling over the uneven ground and
      dragging Joan behind her, but when they came close the wolf-dog bristled
      and sent down the cavern a low growl that stopped them like an invisible
      barrier. The softest sounds in his register were ominous warnings to those
      who did not know Black Bart, but Kate and Joan understood that this
      muttering, harsh thunder was an ultimatum. If she had worn her revolver, a
      light, beautifully mounted thirty-two which Dan had given her, Kate would
      have shot the wolf and gone on across his body; for she had learned from
      Whistling Dan to shoot quickly as one points a finger and straight by
      instinct. Even as she stood there barehanded she looked about her
      desperately for a weapon, seeing the daylight and the promise of escape
      beyond and only this dumb beast between her and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once before, many a year before, she had gone like this, with empty hands,
      and subdued Black Bart simply through the power of quiet courage and the
      human eye. She determined to try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand there quietly, Joan. Don't move until I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a firm step towards Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner, he'll bite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Joan. Don't speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At her forward movement the wolf-dog flattened his belly to the rock, and
      she saw his forepaws, large, almost, as the hands of a man, dig and work
      for a purchase from which he could throw himself at her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Bart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His silence was more terrible than a snarl; yet she stretched out her hand
      and made another step. It brought a sharp tensing of the body of Bart&mdash;the
      fur stood up about his throat like the mane of a lion, and his eyes were a
      devilish green. Another instant she kept her place, and then she
      remembered the story of Haines&mdash;how Bart had gone with his master to
      that killing at Alder. If he had killed once, he would kill again; wild as
      he had been on that other time when she quelled him, he had never before
      been like this. The courage melted out of her; she forgot the pleasant day
      outside; she saw only those blazing eyes and shrank back towards the
      center of the cave. The muscles of the wolf relaxed visibly, and not till
      that moment did she realize how close she had been to the crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad Bart!&rdquo; cried Joan, running in between. &ldquo;Bad, bad dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Joan! Don't go near him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Joan was already almost to Bart. When Kate would have run to snatch
      the child away that deep, rattling growl stopped her again, and now she
      saw that Joan ran not the slightest danger. She stood beside the huge
      beast with her tiny fist raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell Daddy Dan on you,&rdquo; she shrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Bart made a furtive, cringing movement towards the child, but
      instantly stiffened again and sent his warning down the cave to Kate. Then
      a shadow fell across the entrance and Dan stood there with Satan walking
      behind. His glance ran from the bristling body of Bart to Kate, shrinking
      among the shadows, and lingered without a spark of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satan,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;go on in to your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black stallion glided past the master and came on until he saw Kate.
      He stopped, snorting, and then circled her with his head suspiciously
      high, and ears back until he reached the place where his saddle was
      usually hung. There he waited, and Kate felt the eyes of the horse, the
      wolf, the man, and even Joan, curiously upon her. &ldquo;Evenin',&rdquo; nodded Dan,
      &ldquo;might you have come up for supper?&rdquo; That was all. Not a step towards her,
      not a smile, not a greeting, and between them stood Joan, her hands
      clasped idly before her while she looked from face to face, trying to
      understand. All the pangs of heart which come to woman between girlhood
      and old age went burningly through Kate in that breathing space, and
      afterwards she was cold, and saw herself and all the others clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't come for supper. I've come to bring you back, Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not that she had the slightest hope that he would come, but she watched
      him curiously, almost as if he were a stranger, to see how he would
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;To the cabin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't happy there.&rdquo; He started. &ldquo;You come up here with us, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And raise Joan like a young animal in a cave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with wonder, and then at the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you happy, Joan, up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Daddy Dan, Joan's so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said to Kate, &ldquo;she's terribly happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was his utter simplicity which convinced her that arguments and pleas
      would be perfectly useless. Just behind the cool command which she kept
      over herself now was hysteria. She knew that if she relaxed her
      purposefulness for an instant the love for him would rush over her, weaken
      her. She kept her mind clear and steady with a great effort which was like
      divorcing herself from herself. When she spoke, there was another being
      which stood aside listening in wonder to the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've chosen this life, Dan, I won't blame you for leaving me this time
      any more than I blamed you the other times. I suppose it isn't you. It's
      the same impulse, after all, that took you south after&mdash;after the
      wild geese.&rdquo; She stopped, almost broken down by the memory, and then
      recalled herself sternly. &ldquo;It's the same thing that led you away after
      MacStrann through the storm. But whether it's a weakness in you, or the
      force of something outside your control, I see this thing clearly; we
      can't go on. This is the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed troubled, vaguely, as a dog is anxious when it sees a child weep
      and cannot make out the reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dan,&rdquo; she burst out, &ldquo;I love you more than ever! If it were I alone,
      I'd follow you to the end of the world, and live as you live, and do as
      you do. But it's Joan. She has to be raised as a child should be raised.
      She isn't going to live with&mdash;with wild horses and wolves all her
      life. And if she stays on here, don't you see that the same thing which is
      a curse in you will grow strong and be a curse in her? Don't you see it
      growing? It's in her eyes! Her step is too light. She's lost her fear of
      the dark. She's drifting back into wildness. Dan, she has to go with me
      back to the cabin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that she saw him start again, and his hand went out with a swift,
      subtle gesture towards Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have her! I have to have her! She's mine!&rdquo; Then more gently: &ldquo;You
      can come to see her whenever you will. And, finally pray God you will come
      and stay with us always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had stepped to Joan while she spoke, and his hands made a quick
      movement of cherishing about her golden head, without touching it. For the
      first and the last time in her life, she saw something akin to fear in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate, I can't come back. I got things to do&mdash;out here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me take her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She watched the wavering in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things would be kind of empty if she was gone, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked bitterly. &ldquo;You say you have your work to do&mdash;out
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He considered this gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno. Except that I sort of need her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew from of old that such questions only puzzled him, and soon he
      would cast away the attempt to decide, and act. Action was his sphere.
      There was only one matter in which he was unfailingly, relentlessly the
      same, and that was justice. To that sense in him she would make her last
      appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan, I can't take her. I only ask you to see that I'm right. She belongs
      to me, I bought her with pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a staggering blow to Whistling Dan. He took off his sombrero and
      passed his hand slowly across his forehead, then looked at her with a dumb
      appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only want you to do the thing you think is square, Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more he winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, slowly: &ldquo;I'm tryin' to be square. Tryin' hard. I know you got a
      claim in her. But it seems like I have, too. She's like a part of me,
      mostly. When she's happy, I feel like smilin' sort of. When she cries it
      hurts me so's I can't hardly stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, looking wistfully from the staring child to Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said with sudden illumination: &ldquo;Let her do the judgin'! You ask her to
      go to you, and I'll ask her to come to me. Ain't that square?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Kate hesitated, but as she looked at Joan it seemed to her
      that when she stretched out her arms to her baby nothing in the world
      could keep them apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's fair,&rdquo; she answered. Dan dropped to one knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan, you got to make up your mind. If you want to stay with, with Satan&mdash;speak
      up, Satan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stallion whinnied softly, and Joan smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Satan and Black Bart&rdquo;&mdash;the wolf-dog had glided near, and now
      stood watching&mdash;&ldquo;and with Daddy Dan, you just come to me. But if you
      want to go to&mdash;to Munner, you just go.&rdquo; On his face the struggle
      showed&mdash;the struggle to be perfectly just. &ldquo;If you stay here, maybe
      it'll be cold, sometimes when the wind blows, and maybe it'll be hard
      other ways. And if you go to munner, she always be takin' care of you, and
      no harm'll ever come to you and you'll sleep soft between sheets, and if
      you wake up in the night she'll be there to talk to you. And you'll have
      pretty little dresses with all kinds of colors on 'em, most like. Joan, do
      you want to go to munner, or stay here with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the speech was rather long for Joan to follow, but the conclusion
      was plain enough; and there was Kate, she also upon one knee and her arms
      stretched out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan, my baby, my darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner!&rdquo; whispered the child and ran towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A growl came up in the throat of Black Bart and then sank away into a
      whine; Joan stopped short, and turned her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; cried Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anguish made her voice loud, and from the loudness Joan shrank, for there
      was never a harsh sound in the cave except the growl of Bart warning away
      danger. She turned quite around and there stood Daddy Dan, perfectly
      erect, quite indifferent, to all seeming, as to her choice. She went to
      him with a rush and caught at his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Daddy Dan, I don't want to go. Don't you want Joan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid a hand upon her head, and she felt the tremor of his fingers; the
      wolf-dog lay down at her feet and looked up in her face; Satan, from the
      shadows beyond, whinnied again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that there was not a word spoken, for Kate looked at the picture of
      the three, saw the pity in the eyes of Whistling Dan, saw the wonder in
      the eyes of Joan, saw the truth of all she had lost. She turned towards
      the entrance and went out, her head bowed, stumbling over the pebbles.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVI. The Test
    </h2>
    <p>
      The most that could be said of Rickett was that it had a courthouse and
      plenty of quiet so perfect that the minds of the office holders could turn
      and turn and hear no sound saving their own turning. There were, of
      course, more buildings than the courthouse, but not so many that they
      could not be grouped conveniently along one street. The hush which rested
      over Rickett was never broken except in the periods immediately after the
      spring and fall round-ups when the saloons and gaming tables were suddenly
      flooded with business. Otherwise it was a rare event indeed which injected
      excitement into the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an event was the gathering of Sheriff Pete Glass' posse.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been other occasions when Pete and officers before his time had
      combed the county to get the cream of the fighting men, but the gathering
      of the new posse became different in many ways. In the first place the
      call for members was not confined to the county, for though it stretched
      as large as many a minor European kingdom, it had not the population of a
      respectable manufacturing town, and Pete Glass went far beyond its bounds
      to get his trailers. Everywhere he had the posters set up and on the
      posters appeared the bait. The state began the game with a reward of three
      thousand dollars; the county plastered two thousand dollars on top of that
      to make it an even five: then the town of Alder dug into its deep pockets
      and produced twenty-five hundred, while disinterested parties added
      contributions which swelled the total to a round ten thousand. Ten
      thousand dollars reward for the man described below, dead or alive. Ten
      thousand dollars which might be earned by the investment of a single
      bullet and the pressure on trigger; and above this the fame which such a
      deed would bring&mdash;no wonder that the mountain-desert hummed through
      all its peaks and plains, and stirred to life. Moreover, the news had gone
      abroad, the tale of the Killing of Alder and everything that went before.
      It went West; it appeared in newspapers; it cropped up at firesides; it
      gave a spark of terror to a myriad conversations; and every one in Rickett
      felt that the eye of the nation was upon it; every one in Rickett dreamed
      nightly of the man described: &ldquo;Daniel Barry, called Whistling Dan, about
      five feet nine or ten, slender, black hair, brown eyes, age about thirty
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Secretly, Rickett felt perfectly convinced that Sheriff Pete Glass alone
      could handle this fellow and trim his claws for they knew how many a &ldquo;bad
      man&rdquo; had built a reputation high as Babel and baffled posses and murdered
      right and left, until the little dusty man on the little dusty roan went
      out alone and came back alone, and another fierce name went from history
      into legend. However, there were doubters, since this affair had new
      earmarks. It had been buzzed abroad that Whistling Dan was not only the
      hunted, but also the hunter, and that he had pledged himself to strike
      down all the seven who first took his trail. Five of these were already
      gone; two remained, and of these two one was Vic Gregg, no despicable
      fighter himself, and the other was no less than the invincible little
      sheriff himself. To imagine the sheriff beaten in the speed of his draw or
      the accuracy of his shot was to imagine the First Cause, Infinity, or
      whatever else is inconceivable; nevertheless, there were such
      possibilities as bullets fired at night through the window, and attacks
      from the rear. So Rickett waited, and held its breath and kept his eyes
      rather more behind than in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, there was no lack of amusement, for from the four
      corners, blown by the four winds, men rode out of the mountain-desert and
      drifted into Rickett to seek for a place on that posse. Twenty men, that
      was the goal the sheriff had set. Twenty men trained to a hair. Beside the
      courthouse was a shooting gallery not overmuch used except during the two
      annual seasons of prosperity and reckless spending, and Pete Glass secured
      this place to test out applicants. After, they passed this trial they were
      mustered into his presence, and he gave them an examination for himself.
      Just what he asked them or what he could never be known, but some men came
      from his presence very red, and others extremely pale, and some men
      blustered, and some men swore, and some men rode hastily out of town and
      spoke not a word, but few, very few, were those who came out wearing a
      little badge on their vest with the pride of a Knight of the Garter. At
      first the hordes rode in, young and old, youths keen for a taste of
      adventure, rusty fellows who had once been noted warriors; but these early
      levies soon discovered that courage and willingness was not so much valued
      as accuracy, and the old-timers learned, also, that accuracy must be
      accompanied by speed; and even when a man possessed both these qualities
      of hand and eye the gentle, inscrutable little man in his office might
      still reject them for reasons they could not guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      This one thing was certain: the next time Pete Glass ran for office he
      would be beaten even by a greaser. He made enemies at the rate of a
      hundred a day during that period of selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the twenty was not recruited to the full. Thirteen, fourteen,
      fifteen were gathered into the fold, but still five men were lacking to
      complete the toll. Most men would have started their man-hunt with that
      formidable force, but Pete Glass was methodical. In his own heart of
      hearts he would have given his hope of heaven to meet Barry face to face
      and hand to hand, and see which was the better man, but Pete Glass owed a
      duty to his state before he owed a duty to himself. He stuck by his first
      plan. And every day the inhabitants of Rickett gathered at the shooting
      gallery to watch the tests and wonder at the successes and smile at the
      failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very hard test which the sheriff had imposed. A man stood to one
      side of the iron-plate back wall which served as the target. He stood
      entirely out of sight and through an aperture in the side wall, at a
      signal, he tossed a round ball of clay, painted white. The marksman stood
      a good ten paces off, and he must strike that clay ball as it passed
      across the target. The balls were so small that even to strike them when
      they were stationary was a difficult task, and to hit them in motion was
      enough to task the quickest eye and the cunningest hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was old Pop Giersberg who stood with his ancient forty-five behind the
      counter, with his feet braced, on this bright morning, and behind him half
      of Rickett was gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'you give me warnin', son?&rdquo; he inquired of the man at the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nary a warnin',&rdquo; grinned the other, who was one of the chosen fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished Pop well. So did they all, but they had seen every man fail for
      two days at that target and one and all they had their doubts. Pop had
      been a formidable man in his day, but now his hand was stiff and his hair
      gray. He was at least twenty years older than he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly finished asking his question when a white ball was tossed
      across the target. Up came the gun of Pop Giersberg, exploded, and the
      bullet clanged on the iron; the white ball floated idly on across the wall
      and disappeared on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme another chance!&rdquo; pleaded Pop, with a quaver in his voice. &ldquo;That was
      just a try to get my eye in shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; chuckled the deputy. &ldquo;Everybody gets three tries. It ain't hardly
      nacheral to hit that ball the first crack. Leastways, nobody ain't done it
      yet. You jest keep your eye peeled, Pop, and that ball will come out
      ag'in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pop literally kept his eye peeled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had double reason to pray for success, for his &ldquo;old woman&rdquo; had smiled
      and shook her head when he allowed that he would try out for a place on
      that posse. All his nerves grew taut and keen. He waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the white streak appeared and surely he who threw the ball had
      every wish to see Pop succeed, for he tossed it high and easily. Again the
      gun barked from Giersberg's hand, and again the ball dropped almost slowly
      out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a trick!&rdquo; gasped Pop. &ldquo;It's something damned queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They's a considerable pile of gents, that think the same way you do,&rdquo;
       admitted the deputy sheriff, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pop glared at him and gritted his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead the damn thing on ag'in,&rdquo; he said, and muttered the rest of his
      sentence to himself. He jerked his hat lower over his eyes, spread his
      feet a little more, and got ready for the last desperate chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But fate was against Pop. Twenty years before he might have struck that
      mark if he had been in top condition, but today, though he put his very
      soul into the effort, and though the ball for the third time was lobbed
      with the utmost gentleness through the air, his bullet banged vainly
      against the sheet of iron and the white, inoffensive ball continued on its
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Words came in the throat of Pop, reached his opened mouth, and died there.
      He thrust the gun back into its holster, and turned slowly toward the
      crowd. There was no smile to meet his challenging eye, for Pop was a known
      man, and though he might have failed to strike this elusive mark that was
      no sign that he would fail to hit something six feet in height by a couple
      in breadth. When he found that no mockery awaited him, a sheepish smile
      began at his eyes and wandered dimly to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gents,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I guess I ain't as young as I was once.
      S'long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shouldered his way to the door and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about all, friends,&rdquo; said the deputy crisply. &ldquo;I guess there ain't
      any more clamorin's for a place today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swept the crowd with a complacent eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you got no objection,&rdquo; murmured a newcomer, who had just slipped into
      the room, &ldquo;I'd sort of like to take a shot at that.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVII. The Sixth Man
    </h2>
    <h3>
      It caused a quick turning of heads.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to put you out none,&rdquo; said the applicant gently. His voice
      was extremely gentle, and there was about him all the shrinking aloofness
      of the naturally timid. The deputy looked him over with quiet amusement&mdash;slender
      fellow with the gentlest brown eyes&mdash;and then with a quick side
      glance invited the crowd to get in on the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't puttin' me out,&rdquo; he assured the other. &ldquo;Not if you pay for your
      own ammunition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered the would-be man-hunter, &ldquo;I reckon I could afford
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so serious about it that the crowd murmured its amusement instead
      of bursting into loud laughter. If the man was a fool, at least he was not
      aggressive in his folly. They gave way and he walked slowly towards the
      counter and stepped into the little open space beside the master of
      ceremonies. Very obviously he was ill at ease to find himself the center
      of so much attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s'pose you been practicin' up on tin-cans?&rdquo; suggested the deputy,
      leaning on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I hit things and sometimes I don't,&rdquo; answered the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; and this was put more crisply as the deputy brought out a large
      pad of paper, &ldquo;jest gimme your name, partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe Cumber.&rdquo; He grew still more ill at ease. &ldquo;I hear that even if you hit
      the mark you got to talk to the sheriff himself afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The applicant sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why d'you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't much on words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But hell with your gun, eh?&rdquo; The deputy sheriff grinned again, but when
      the other turned his head toward him, his smile went out, suddenly while
      the wrinkle of mirth still lay in his cheek. The deputy stroked his chin
      and looked thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get your gun ready,&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other slipped his hand down to his gun-butt and moved his weapon to
      make sure that it was perfectly loose in the leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you goin' to take your gun out?&rdquo; queried the deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon not,&rdquo; said the deputy, and looked the stranger straight in the
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His change to deadly earnestness put a hush over the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the target, not tossed easily as it had been for Pop Giersberg, but
      literally thrown, darted the line of white, while the gun flipped out of
      its holster as if it possessed life of its own and spoke. The white line
      ended half way to the farther side of the target, and the revolver slid
      again into hiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clamor of amazement broke from the crowd, but the deputy looked
      steadily, without enthusiasm, at the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe Cumber,&rdquo; he said, when the noise fell away a little, &ldquo;I guess you'll
      see the sheriff. Harry, take Joe Cumber up to Pete, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the bystanders jumped at the suggestion and led the other from the
      room, with a full half of the crowd following. The deputy remained behind,
      thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked one of the spectators. &ldquo;You look like you'd
      seen a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gents,&rdquo; answered the deputy, &ldquo;do any of you recollect seein' this feller
      before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They's something queer about him,&rdquo; muttered the deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be word-shy,&rdquo; proffered a wit, &ldquo;but he sure ain't gun-shy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he looked at me,&rdquo; said the deputy, more to himself than to the
      others, &ldquo;it seemed to me like they was a swirl of yaller come into his
      eyes. Made me feel like some one had sneaked up behind me with a knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his thoughtfulness his eyes wandered, and wandering, they fell upon the
      notice of the reward for the capture, dead or alive, of Daniel Barry,
      about five feet nine or ten, slender, with black hair and brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried the deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then he relaxed against the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't possible,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ain't possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, I'm goin' to go and hang around. Gents, I got a crazy idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had no sooner started toward the door than he seemed to gain surety out
      of the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's him!&rdquo; he cried. He turned toward the others, white of face. &ldquo;Come
      on, all of you! It's him! Barry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in the meantime Harry had gone on swiftly to the office of the sheriff
      with &ldquo;Joe Cumber.&rdquo; Behind him swirled the curious crowd and for their
      benefit he asked his questions loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partner, that was sure a pretty play you made. I've seen 'em all try out
      to crack them balls, but I never seen none do it the way you did&mdash;with
      your gun in the leather at the start. What part of the country might you
      be from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other answered gently: &ldquo;Why, from over yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The T O outfit, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up in the Gray Mountains? That so! I s'pose you been on trails like this
      before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin' to talk about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There might have been a double meaning in this remark, and Harry looked
      twice to make sure that there was no guile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here we are.&rdquo; He threw open a door which revealed a bald-headed
      clerk seated at a desk in a little bare room. &ldquo;Billy, here's a gent that
      cracked it the first whack and started his gun from the leather, by God.
      He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest kindly close the door, Harry,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;Step in, partner. Gimme
      your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed on the discomfited Harry, and &ldquo;Joe Cumber&rdquo; stood close to
      it, apparently driven to shrinking into the wall in his embarrassment, but
      while he stood there his hand fumbled behind him and turned the key in the
      lock, and then extracted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name's Joe Cumber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe Cumber,&rdquo;&mdash;this while inscribing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About thirty-two, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were as vague as his words, gentle, and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-two?&rdquo; said Billy sharply. &ldquo;You look more like twenty-five to me.
      S'pose we split the difference, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a grin he wrote: &ldquo;Age twenty-two or three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trapper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! The sheriff is pretty keen for 'em. You gents in that game got a
      sort of nose for the trail, mostly. All right, Cumber, you'll see Glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Cumber, is that straight about startin' your shot with your
      gun in the holster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s'pose it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You s'pose?&rdquo; grunted the clerk. &ldquo;Well, come on in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He banged once on the door and then threw it open. &ldquo;Joe Cumber, Pete. And
      he drilled the ball startin' his gun out of the leather. Here's his card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door, and once more the stranger stood almost cringing
      against it, and once more his fingers deftly turned the key&mdash;softly,
      silently&mdash;and extracted it from the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff had not looked up from the study of the card, for reading was
      more difficult to him than man-killing, and Joe Cumber had an opportunity
      to examine the room. It was hung with a score of pictures. Some large,
      some small, but most of them enlargements, it was apparent of kodak
      snapshots, for the eyes had that bleary look which comes in photographs
      spread over ten times their intended space. The faces had little more than
      bleary eyes in common, for there were bearded men, and smooth-shaven
      faces, and lean and fat men; there were round, cherubic countenances, and
      lean, hungry heads; there were squared, protruding chins, and there were
      chins which sloped away awkwardly toward the neck; in fact it seemed that
      the sheriff had collected twenty specimens to represent every phase of
      weakness and strength in the human physiognomy. But beneath the pictures,
      almost without exception, there hung weapons: rifles, revolvers, knives,
      placed criss-cross in a decorative manner, and it came to &ldquo;Joe Cumber&rdquo;
       that he was looking at the galaxy of the dead who had fallen by the hand
      of Sheriff Pete Glass. Not a face meant anything to him but he knew,
      instinctively, that they were the chosen bad men of the past twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're Joe Cumber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff turned in his swivel chair and tossed his cigarette butt
      through the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got an idea, sheriff, that maybe you'd sort of like to have my
      picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff looked up from his study of the card, and having looked up his
      eyes remained riveted. The other no longer cringed with embarrassment, but
      every line of his body breathed a great happiness. He was like one who has
      been riding joyously, with a sharp wind in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a distant rushing of feet, a pounding on the door of the next
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; muttered the sheriff, his attention called away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; called the voice of Billy without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll open the door. By God, it's locked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want me&mdash;five feet nine or ten, slender, black hair and brown
      eyes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glass, I've come for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm ready. And I'll say this&rdquo;&mdash;he was standing, now, and his
      nervous hands were at his sides&mdash;&ldquo;I been hungerin' and hopin' for
      this time to come. Barry, before you die, I want to thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've followed me like a skunk,&rdquo; said Barry, &ldquo;from the time you killed a
      hoss that had never done no harm to you. You got on my trail when I was
      livin' peaceable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a tremendous beating on the outer door of the other room, but
      Barry went on: &ldquo;You took a gent that was livin' straight and you made a
      sneak and a crook out of him and sent him to double-cross me. You ain't
      worth livin'. You've spent your life huntin' men, and now you're at the
      end of your trail. Think it over. You're ready to kill ag'in, but are you
      ready to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little dusty man grew dustier still. His mouth worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you,&rdquo; he whispered, and went for his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was out, his finger on the trigger, the barrel whipping into line, when
      the weapon in Barry's hand exploded. The sheriff spun on his heel and fell
      on his face. Three times, as he lay there, dead in all except the
      instinctive movement of his muscles, his right hand clawed at the empty
      holster at his side. The sixth man had died for Grey Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outer door of Billy's room crashed to the floor, and heavy feet
      thundered nearer. Barry ran to the window and whistled once, very high and
      thin. It brought a black horse racing around a corner nearby; it brought a
      wolf-dog from an opposite direction, and as they drew up beneath the
      window, he slid out and dropped lightly, catlike, to the ground. One leap
      brought him to the saddle, and Satan stretched out along the street.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVIII. The Blood Of The Father
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the night of her failure at the cave, Kate came back to the cabin and
      went to her room without any word to Buck or Lee Haines, but when they sat
      before the fire, silent, or only murmuring, they could hear her moving
      about. Whatever sleep they got before morning was not free from dreams,
      for they knew that something was impending, and after breakfast they
      learned what it was. She struck straight out from the shoulder. She was
      going up to the cave and if Dan was away she would take Joan by force; she
      needed help; would they give it? They sat for a long time, looking at each
      other and then avoiding Kate with their eyes. It was not the fear of death
      but of something more which both of them connected with the figure of
      Whistling Dan. It was not until she took her light cartridge belt from the
      wall and buckled on her gun that they rose to follow. Before the first
      freshness of the morning passed they were winding up the side of the
      mountain, Kate a little in the lead, for she alone knew the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where they rounded the shoulder, the men reined the horses with which Kate
      had provided them and sat looking solemnly at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe we'll have no chance to talk alone again,&rdquo; said Lee Haines. &ldquo;This
      is the last trail either for Barry or for us. And I don't think that Barry
      is that close to the end of his rope. Buck, give me your hand and say
      good-bye. All that a man can do against Whistling Dan, and that isn't
      much, I'll do. Having you along won't make us a whit stronger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; growled Buck Daniels. &ldquo;Jes save that kind farewell till I show
      yaller. Hurry up, she's gettin' too far ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom of the ravine, where they dismounted for the precipitous
      slope above, Kate showed her first hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You both know what it means?&rdquo; she asked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sure do,&rdquo; replied Buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan will find out that you've helped me, and then he'll never forgive
      you. Will you risk even that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; broke in Lee Haines, &ldquo;don't stop for questions. Keep on and we'll
      follow. I don't want to think of what may happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned without a word and went up the steep incline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'you think of your soft girl now?&rdquo; panted Buck at the ear of
      Haines. The latter flashed a significant look at him but said nothing.
      They reached the top of the canyon wall and passed on among the boulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate had drawn back to them now, and they walked as cautiously as if there
      were dried leaves under foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had only lifted a finger of warning, and they knew that they were near
      to the crisis. She came to the great rock around which she had first seen
      the entrance to the cave on the day before. Inch by inch, with Buck and
      Lee following her example, they worked toward the edge of the boulder and
      peered carefully around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There opened the cave, and in front of it was Joan playing with what
      seemed to be a ball of gray fur. Her hair tumbled loose and bright about
      her shoulders; she wore the tawny hide which Kate had seen before, and on
      her feet, since the sharp rocks had long before worn out her boots, she
      had daintily fashioned moccasins. Bare knees, profusely scratched, bare
      arms rapidly browning to the color of the fur she wore, Haines and Buck
      had to rub their eyes and look again before they could recognize her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must have made a noise&mdash;perhaps merely an intaking of breath
      inaudible even to themselves but clear to the ears of Joan. She was on her
      feet, with bright, wild eyes glancing here and there. There was no
      suggestion of childishness in her, but a certain willingness to flee from
      a great danger or attack a weaker force. She stood alert, rather than
      frightened, with her head back as if she scented the wind to learn what
      approached. The ball of gray fur straightened into the sharp ears and the
      flashing teeth of a coyote puppy. Buck Daniels' foot slipped on a pebble
      and at the sound the coyote darted to the shadow of a little shrub and
      crouched there, hardly distinguishable from the shade which covered it,
      and the child, with infinitely cunning instinct, raced to a patch of
      yellow sand and tawny rocks among which she cowered and remained there
      moveless.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing at least was certain. Whistling Dan was not in the cave, for if
      he had been the child would have run to him for protection, or at least
      cried out in her alarm. This information Haines whispered to Kate and she
      nodded, turning a white face toward him. Then she stepped out from the
      rock and went straight toward Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no stir in the little figure. Even the wind seemed to take part
      in the secret and did not lift the golden hair. Once the eyes of the child
      glittered as they turned toward Kate, but otherwise she made no motion,
      like a rabbit which will not budge until the very shadow of the reaching
      hand falls over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was with Joan, and as Kate leaned silently over her she sprang to
      her feet and darted between the hands of her mother and away among the
      rocks. Past the reaching hands of Lee Haines she swerved, but it was only
      to run straight into the grip of Buck Daniels. Up to that moment she had
      not uttered a sound, but now she screamed out, twisted in his arms, and
      beat furiously against his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; cried Kate. &ldquo;Joan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached Buck and unwound his arms from the struggling body of the
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honey, why are you afraid? Oh, my baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Joan stood free, wavering, and her eyes held steadily upon
      her mother bright with nothing but fear and strangeness. Then something
      melted in her little round face, she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner!&rdquo; and stole a pace closer. A moment later Kate sat with Joan in
      her arms, rocking to and fro and weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's happened?&rdquo; gasped Haines to Daniels. &ldquo;What's happened to the kid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk,&rdquo; answered Buck, his face gray as that of Kate. &ldquo;It's Dan's
      blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a great breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see her try to&mdash;to bite me while I was holdin' her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate had started to her feet, holding Joan in one arm and dashing away her
      tears with the free hand. All weakness was gone from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;We haven't any time to lose. Buck, come here! No,
      Lee, you're stronger. Honey, this is your Uncle Lee. He'll take care of
      you; he won't hurt you. Will you go to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joan shrank away while she examined him, but the instincts of a child move
      with thrice the speed of a mature person's judgment; she read the kindly
      honesty which breathed from every line of Haines' face, and held out her
      arms to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they started down the slope for the horses, running wildly, for the
      moment they turned their backs on the cave the same thought was in the
      mind of each, the same haunting fear of that small, shrill whistle
      pursuing. Half running, half sliding, they went down to the bottom of the
      gorge. While the pebble they started rushed after them in small
      avalanches, and they even had to dodge rocks of considerable size which
      came bounding after, Joan, alert upon the shoulder of Lee Haines, enjoyed
      every moment of it; her hair tossed in the sun, her arms were outstretched
      for balance. So they reached the horses, and climbed into the saddles.
      Then, without a word from one to the other, but with many a backward look,
      they started on the flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they reached the shoulder of the hill on the farther side,
      with a long stretch of down slope before, they had placed a large handicap
      between them and the danger of pursuit, but still they were not at ease.
      On their trail, sooner or later, would come three powers working towards
      one end, the surety of Black Bart following a scent, the swiftness of
      Satan which never tired, and above all the rider who directed them both
      and kept them to their work. His was the arm which could strike from the
      distance and bring them down. They spurted down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner were they in full motion than Joan, for the first time, seemed
      to realize what it was all about. She was still carried by Lee Haines, who
      cradled her easily in his powerful left arm, but now she began to
      struggle. Then she stiffened and screamed: &ldquo;Daddy Dan! Daddy Dan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, stop her mouth or he'll hear!&rdquo; groaned Buck Daniels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can't!&rdquo; said Haines. &ldquo;We're too far away even if he were at the cave
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you he'll hear! Don't talk to me about distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate reined her horse beside Lee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sweeping across the meadow now at an easy gallop. Joan screamed
      again, a wild plea for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; repeated Kate, and her voice was fierce. She raised her quirt and
      shook it. &ldquo;Be quiet, Munner whip&mdash;hard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another call died away on the lips of Joan. She looked at her mother with
      astonishment and then with a new respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you cry once more, munner whip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Joan was silent, staring with wonder and defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came close to the cabin, Lee Haines drew rein, but Kate motioned
      him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to the old ranch,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;We've got to have help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded in grim understanding, and they headed on and down the slope
      towards the valley.

      Chapter XXIX. Billy The Clerk
    </h2>
    <p>
      If Sheriff Pete Glass had been the typical hard-riding, sure-shooting
      officer of the law as it is seen in the mountain-desert, his work would
      have died with his death, but Glass had a mind as active as his hands, and
      therefore, for at least a little while, his work went on after him. He had
      gathered fifteen practiced fighters who represented, it might be said, the
      brute body of the law, and when they, with most of Rickett at their heels,
      burst down the door of the Sheriff's office and found his body, they had
      only one thought, which was to swing into the saddle and ride on the trail
      of the killer, who was even now in a diminishing cloud of dust down the
      street. He was riding almost due east, and the cry went up: &ldquo;He's
      streakin' it for the Morgan Hills. Git after him, boys!&rdquo; So into the
      saddle they went with a rush, fifteen tried men on fifteen chosen horses,
      and went down the street with a roar of hoof-beats. That was the body and
      muscle of the sheriff's work going out to avenge him, but the mind of the
      law remained behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was old Billy, the clerk. No one paid particular attention to Billy,
      and they never had. He was useless on a horse and ridiculous with a gun,
      and the only place where he seemed formidable was behind a typewriter. Now
      he sat looking, down into the dead face of Pete Glass, trying to grasp the
      meaning of it all. From the first he had been with Pete, from the first
      the invincibility of the little dusty man had been the chief article of
      Billy's creed, and now his dull eyes, bleared with thirty years of
      clerical labor, wandered around on the galaxy of dead men who looked down
      at him from the wall. He leaned over and took the hand of the sheriff as
      one would lean to help up a fallen man, but the fingers were already
      growing cold, and then Billy realized for the first time that this was
      death. Pete Glass had been; Pete Glass was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he knew that something had to be done, but what it was he could not
      tell, for he sat in the sheriff's office and in that room he was
      accustomed to stop thinking and receive orders. He went back to his own
      little cubby-hole, and sat down behind the typewriter; at once his mind
      cleared, thoughts came, and linked themselves into ideas, pictures, plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murderer must be taken, dead or alive, and those fifteen men had
      ridden out to do the necessary thing. They had seemed irresistible, as
      they departed; indeed, no living thing they met could withstand them,
      human or otherwise, as Billy very well knew. Yet he recalled a saying of
      the sheriff, a thing he had insisted upon: &ldquo;No man on no hoss will ever
      ride down Whistlin' Dan Barry. It's been tried before and it's never
      worked. I've looked up his history and it can't be done. If he's goin' to
      be ran down it's got to be done with relays, like you was runnin' down a
      wild hoss.&rdquo; Billy rubbed his bald head and thought and thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that orderliness which had become his habit of mind, from work with
      reports and papers, sorting and filing away, Billy went back to the
      beginning. Dan Barry was fleeing. He started from Rickett, and nine
      chances out of ten he was heading, eventually, towards those practically
      impenetrable mountain ranges where the sheriff before had lost the trail
      after the escape from the cabin and the killing of Mat Henshaw. Towards
      this same region, again, he had retreated after the notorious Killing at
      Alder. There was no doubt, then, humanly speaking, that he would make for
      the same safe refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first glance this seemed quite improbable, to be sure, for the Morgan
      Hills lay due east, or very nearly east, while the place from which Barry
      must have sallied forth and to which he would return was somewhere well
      north of west, and a good forty miles away. It seemed strange that he
      should strike off in the opposite direction, so Billy closed his eyes,
      leaned back in his chair, and summoned up a picture of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five miles to the east the Morgan Hills rolled, sharply broken ups and
      downs of country&mdash;bad lands rather than real hills, and a difficult
      region to keep game in view. That very idea gave Billy his clue. Barry
      knew that he would be followed hard and fast, and he headed straight for
      the Morgan's to throw the posse off the final direction he intended to
      take in his flight. In spite of the matchless speed of that black stallion
      of which the sheriff had learned so much, he would probably let the posse
      keep within easy view of him until he was deep within the bad-lands. Then
      he would double, sharply around and strike out in the true direction of
      his flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached this point in his deductions, Billy smote his hands
      together. He was trembling with excitement so that he filled his pipe with
      difficulty. By the time it was drawing well he was back examining his
      mental picture of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      West of Rickett about the same distance as Morgan Hills, ran the Wago
      Mountains, low, rolling ranges which would hardly form an impediment for a
      horseman. Across these Barry might cut at a good speed on his western
      course, but some fifteen or twenty miles from Rickett he was bound to
      reach a most difficult barrier. It was the Asper river, at this season of
      the year swollen high and swift with snow-water&mdash;a rare feat indeed
      if a man could swim his horse across such a stream. There were only two
      places in which it could be forded.
    </p>
    <p>
      About fifty miles north and a little east of the line from Rickett the
      Asper spread out into a broad, shallow bed, its streams dispersed for
      several miles into a number of channels which united again, farther down
      the course, and made the same strong river. Towards this ford, therefore,
      it was possible that Dan Barry would head, in the region of Caswell City.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, another way of crossing the stream. Almost due west of
      Rickett, a distance of fifteen miles, Tucker Creek joined the Asper. Above
      the point of junction both the creek and the river were readily fordable,
      and Barry could cross them and head straight for his goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true that to make Tucker Creek he would have to double out of the
      Morgan Hills and brush back perilously close to Rickett, but Billy was
      convinced that this was the outlaw's plan; for though the Caswell City
      fords would be his safest route it would take him a day's ride, on an
      ordinary horse, out of his way. Besides, the sheriff had always said:
      &ldquo;Barry will play the chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy would have ventured his life that the fugitive would strike straight
      for the Creek as soon as he doubled out of Morgan Hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doors began to bang; a hundred pairs of boots thudded and jingled towards
      Billy; the noise of voices rolled through the outer hall, poured through
      the door, burst upon his ears. He looked up in mild surprise; the first
      wave of Rickett's men had swept out of the courthouse to take the trail of
      the fugitive or to watch the pursuit; in this second wave came the
      remnants, the old men, the women; great-eyed children. In spite of their
      noise of foot and voice they appeared to be trying to walk stealthily,
      talk so softly. They leaned about his desk and questioned him with
      gesticulations, but he only stared. They were all dim as dream people to
      Billy the clerk, whose mind was far away struggling with his problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pore old Billy is kind of dazed,&rdquo; suggested a woman. &ldquo;Don't bother him,
      Bud. Look here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tide of noise and faces broke on either side of the desk and swayed
      off towards the inner office and vaguely Billy felt that they should not
      be there&mdash;the sheriff's privacy&mdash;the thought almost drew him
      back to complete consciousness, but he was borne off from them, again, on
      a wave of study, pictures. Off there to the east went the fifteen best men
      of the mountain-desert on the trail of the slender fellow with the black
      hair and the soft brown eyes. How he had seemed to shrink with aloofness,
      timidity, when he stood there at the door, giving his name. It was not
      modesty. Billy knew now; it was something akin to the beasts of prey, who
      shrink from the eyes of men until they are mad with hunger, and in the
      slender man Billy remembered the same shrinking, the same hunger. When he
      struck, no wonder that even the sheriff went down; no wonder if even the
      fifteen men were baffled on that trail; and therefore, it was sufficiently
      insane for him, Billy the clerk, to sit in his office and dream with his
      ineffectual hands of stopping that resistless flight. Yet he pulled
      himself back to his problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering his problem in general, the thing was perfectly simple: Barry
      was sure to head west, and to the west there were only two gates&mdash;fording
      the creek and the river above the junction in the first place, or in the
      second place cutting across the Asper far north at Caswell City.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he could be turned from the direction of Tucker Creek he would head for
      the second possible crossing, and when he drew near Caswell City if he
      were turned by force of numbers again he would unquestionably skirt the
      Asper, hoping against hope that he might find a fordable place as he
      galloped south. But, going south, he might be fenced again from Tucker
      Creek, and then his case would be hopeless and his horse worn down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very clever plan, quite simple after it was once conceived, but
      in order to execute it properly it was necessary that the outlaw be
      pressed hard every inch of the way and never once allowed to get out of
      sight. He must be chased with relays. In ordinary stretches of the
      mountain-desert that would have been impossible, but the country around
      Rickett was not ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the Morgan Hills and Wago there were considerable stretches of
      excellent farm land in the center of which little towns had grown up.
      Running north from the country seat, they were St. Vincent, Wago, and
      Caswell City. Coming south again along the Asper River there were Ganton
      and Wilsonville, and just above the junction of the river with Tucker
      Creek lay the village of Bly Falls. There was no other spot in the
      mountain-desert, perhaps, which could show so many communities. Also it
      was possible to get in touch with the towns from Rickett, for in a wild
      spirit of enterprise telephones had been strung to connect each village of
      the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand went out mechanically and pushed in an open drawer of his filing
      cabinet as if he were closing up the affair, putting away the details of
      the plan. Each point was now clear, orderly assembled. It meant simply
      chasing Barry along a course which covered close to a hundred miles and
      which lay in a loosely shaped U. St. Vincent's was the tip of the eastern
      side of that U. The men of St. Vincent's were to be called out to turn the
      outlaw out of his course towards Tucker Creek, and then, as he struck
      northeast towards Caswell City, they were to furnish the posse with
      fifteen fresh horses, the best they could gather on such short notice.
      Swinging north along that side of the U, Wago would next be warned to get
      its contribution of fifteen horses ready, and this fresh relay would send
      Barry thundering along towards Caswell City at full speed. Then Caswell
      City would send out its contingent of men and horses, and turn the
      fugitive back from the fords. By this time, unless his horse were better
      winded than any that Billy had ever dreamed of, it would be staggering at
      every stride, and the fresh horses from Caswell City would probably ride
      him down before he had gone five miles. Even in case they failed in this,
      there was the little town of Ganton, which would be ready with its men and
      mounts. Perhaps they could hem in the desperado from the front and shoot
      him down there, as he skirted along the river. At the worst they would
      furnish the fresh horses and the fifteen hardy riders would spur at full
      speed south along the river. If again, by some miracle, the black stallion
      lasted out this run, Wilsonville lay due ahead, and that place would again
      give new horses to the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last of all, the men of Bly Falls could be warned. Bly Falls was a town of
      size and it could turn out enough men to block a dozen Dan Barrys, no
      matter how desperate. If he reached that point, he must turn back. The
      following posse would catch him from the rear, and between two fires he
      must die ingloriously. Taking the plan as a whole it meant running Barry
      close to a hundred miles with six sets of horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all hinged, however, on the first step: Could the men of St. Vincent
      turn him out of his western course and send him north towards Caswell
      City? If they could, he was no better than a dead man. All things favored
      Billy. In the first place it was still morning, and eight hours of broad
      daylight would keep the fugitive in view every inch of the way. In the
      second place, much of the distance was cut up by the barb-wire fences of
      the farm-lands, and he must either jump these or else stop to cut them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crackle of laughter cut in on Billy the clerk. They were laughing in
      that inner office, where the sheriff lay dead. Blood swept across his
      eyes, set his brain whirling, and he rushed to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You yelpin' coyotes!&rdquo; shouted Billy the clerk. &ldquo;Get out. I got to be
      alone! Get out, or by God&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not so much his words, or the fear of his threats, but the very
      fact that Billy the clerk, harmless, smiling old Billy, had burst into
      noisy wrath, scared them as if an earthquake had gripped the building.
      They went out sidling, and left the rooms in quiet. Then Billy took up the
      phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete Glass is dead,&rdquo; he was saying a moment later to the owner of the
      general merchandise store at St. Vincent. &ldquo;Barry came in this morning and
      shot him. The boys have run him east to the Morgan Hills. Johnny, listen
      hard and shut up. You got half an hour to turn out every man in your town.
      Ride south till you get in the hills on a bee-line east of where Tucker
      Creek runs into the old Asper. D'ye hear? Then keep your eyes peeled to
      the east, and watch for a man on a black hoss ridin' hard, because Barry
      is sure as hell goin' to double back out of the Morgan Hills and come west
      like a scairt coyote. The posse will be behind him, but they most like be
      a hell of a ways to the bad. Johnny, everything hangs on your turnin'
      Barry back. And have fifteen fresh hosses, the best St. Vincent has, so
      that the boys in the posse can climb on 'em and ride hell-bent for Wago.
      Johnny, if we get him started north he's dead&mdash;and if you turn him
      like I say I'll see that you come in on the reward. D'ye hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was only an inarticulate whoop from the other end of the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy hung up. A little later he was talking to Wago.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XXX. The Morgan Hills
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once out of Rickett, Barry pulled the stallion back to an easy canter. He
      had camped during the latter part of the night near the town and ridden in
      in the morning, so that Satan was full of running. He rebelled now against
      this easy pace, and tossed his head with impatience. No curb restrained
      him, not even a bit; the light hackamore could not have held him for an
      instant, but the voice of the rider kept him in hand. Now, out of
      Rickett's one street, came the thing for which Barry had waited, and
      delayed his course&mdash;a scudding dust cloud. On the top of a rise of
      ground he brought Satan to a halt and looked back, though Black Bart ran
      in a circle around him, and whined anxiously. Bart knew that they should
      be running; there was no good in that ragged dust-cloud. Finally he sat
      down on his haunches and looked his master in the face, quivering with
      eagerness. The posse came closer, at the rate of a racing horse, and near
      at hand the tufts of dust which tossed up above and behind the riders
      dissolved, and Whistling Dan made them out clearly, and more clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one form he looked above all, a big man who rode somewhat slanting;
      but Vic Gregg was not among the crowd, and for the rest, Barry had no wish
      to come within range of their harm. The revolver at his side, the rifle in
      the case, were for the seventh man who must die for Grey Molly. These who
      followed him mattered nothing&mdash;except that he must not come within
      their reach. He studied them calmly as they swept nearer, fifteen chosen
      men as he could tell by their riding, on fifteen choice horses as he could
      tell by their gait. If they pushed him into a corner&mdash;well, five men
      were odds indeed, yet he would not have given them a thought; ten men made
      it a grim affair, but still he might have taken a chance; however, fifteen
      men made a battle suicide&mdash;he simply must not let them corner him.
      Particularly fifteen such men as these, for in the mountain-desert where
      all men are raised gun in hand, these were the quickest and the surest
      marksmen. Each one of them had struck that elusive white ball in motion,
      and each had done it with a revolver. What could they do with a rifle?
    </p>
    <p>
      That thought might have sent him rushing Satan down the farther slope, but
      instead, he raised his head a little more and began to whistle softly to
      himself. Satan locked an ear back to listen; Black Bart rose with a
      muffled growl. The posse rode in clear view now, and at their head was a
      tall, lean man with the sun glinting now and again on his yellow
      moustaches. He threw out his arm and the posse scattered towards the left.
      Obviously he was the accepted leader, and indeed few men in the
      mountain-desert would not willingly have followed Mark Retherton. Another
      gesture from Retherton, and at once a dozen guns gleaned, and a dozen
      bullets whizzed perilously close to Barry, then the reports came barking
      up to him; he was just a little out of range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he lingered for a moment before he turned Satan reluctantly, it
      seemed, and started him down the far slope, straightaway for the Morgan
      Hills as old Billy had prophesied. It would be no exercise canter even for
      Satan, for the horses which followed were rare of their kind, and the
      western horse at the worst has manifold fine points. His ancestor is the
      Barb or the Arab which the Spaniards brought with them to Mexico and the
      descendants of that finest of equine bloods made up the wild herds which
      soon roamed the mountain-desert to the north. Long famines of winter, hot
      deserts in summer, changed their appearance. Their heads grew lumpier,
      their necks more scraggy, their croups more slanting, their legs shorter;
      but their hoofs grew denser, hardier, their shorter coupling gave them
      greater weight-carrying possibilities, the stout bones and the clean lines
      of their legs meant speed, and above all they kept the stout heart of the
      thoroughbred and they gained more than this, an indomitable, bulldog
      persistence. The cheapest Western cow-pony may look like the cartoon of a
      horse, but he has points which a judge will note, and he will run a
      picture horse to death in three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the horses which took the trail of Satan and they were chosen
      specimens of their kind. Up the slope they stormed and there went Satan
      skimming across the hollow beneath them. Their blood was his blood, their
      courage his courage, their endurance his endurance. The difference between
      them was the difference between the factory machine and the hand made work
      of art. From his pasterns to his withers, from his hoofs to his croup
      every muscle was perfectly designed and perfectly placed for speed,
      tireless running; every bone was the maximum of lightness and strength
      combined. A feather bloom on a steady wind, such was the gait of Satan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the hollow the posse thundered, and up the farther slope, and still
      the black slipped away from them until Mark Retherton cursed deeply to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't race your hosses, boys,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Keep 'em in hand. That devil
      is playing with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a result, they checked their mounts to merely a fast gallup, and Barry,
      looking back, laughed softly with understanding. Far different the
      laborious pounding of the posse and the light stretch of Satan beneath
      him. He leaned a little until he could catch the sound of the breathing,
      big, steady draughts with comfortable intervals between. He could run like
      that all day, it seemed, and Whistling Dan ran his fingers luxuriously
      down the shining neck. Instantly the head tossed up, and a short whinney
      whipped back to him like a question. Just before them the Morgan Hills
      jutted up, like stiff mud chopped by the tread of giants. &ldquo;Now, partner,&rdquo;
       murmured Barry, &ldquo;show 'em what you can do! Jest lengthen out a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steady breeze from the running sharpened into a gale, whisking about
      his face; there was no longer the wave-like rock of that swinging gallup
      but a smooth, swift succession of impulses. Rocks, shrubs darted past him,
      and he felt a gradual settling of the horse beneath him as the strides
      lengthened, From behind a yell of dismay, and with a backward glance he
      saw every man of the posse leaning forward and swinging his quirt. An
      instant later half a dozen of the ragged little hills closed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once fairly into the heart of the Morgans, he called the stallion back
      from the racing stride to a long canter, and from the gallop to a rapid
      trot, for in this broken country it was wearing on an animal to maintain a
      lope up hill and down the quick, jerking falls. The cowpuncher hates the
      trot, for his ponies are not built for it, but the deep play of Satan's
      fetlock joints broke the hard impacts; his gait now was hardly more
      jarring than the flow of the single-foot in an ordinary animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Bart, who had been running directly under the nose of the stallion,
      now skirted away in the lead. Here and there he twisted among the gullies
      at a racing clip, his head high, and always he picked out the smoothest
      ground, the easiest rise, the gentlest descent which lay more or less
      straight in the line of his master's flight. It cut down the work of the
      stallion by half to have this swift, sure scout run before and point out
      the path, yet it was stiff labor at the best and Barry was glad when he
      came on the hard gravel of an old creek bed cutting at right angels to his
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first he had intended to run towards the Morgans only to cover
      the true direction of his flight, and now, since the posse was hopelessly
      left behind him, well out of hearing, he rode Satan into the middle of the
      creek bed and swung him north.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was bad going for a horse carrying a rider, and even the catlike
      certainty of Satan's tread could not avoid sharp edges here and there that
      might cut his hoofs. So Barry leaped to the ground and ran at full speed
      down the bed. Behind him Satan followed, his ears pricked uneasily, and
      Black Bart, at a signal from the master, dropped back and remained at the
      first bend of the old, empty stream. In a moment they wound out of sight
      even of Bart, but Barry kept steadily on. It would take a magnifying glass
      to read his trail over those rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had covered a mile, perhaps, when Bart came scurrying again and leaped
      joyously around the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've hit the creek, eh?&rdquo; said Whistling Dan. &ldquo;Well, they'll mill
      around a while and like as not they'll run a course south to pick me up
      agin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gestured toward the side, and as soon as Satan stood on the good going
      once more, Barry swung into the saddle and headed straight back west. No
      doubt the posse would ride up and down the creek bed until they found his
      trail turning back, but they would lose precious minutes picking it up,
      and in the meantime he would be far, far away toward the ford of Tucker
      Creek. Then, clearly, but no louder than the snapping of a dry twig near
      his ear, he heard the report of a revolver and it spoke to him of many
      things as the baffled posse rode up and down the creek bed hunting for the
      direction of his escape. Some one had fired that shot to relieve his
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He neither spoke to Satan nor struck him, but there was a slight leaning
      forward, an imperceptible flexing of the leg muscles, and in response the
      black sprang again into the swift trot which sent him gliding over the
      ground, and twisting back and forth among the sharp-sided gullies with a
      movement as smooth as the run of the wolf-dog, which once again raced
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came out in view of the rolling plain Barry stopped again and
      glanced to the west and the north, while Black Bart ran to the top of the
      nearest hill and looked back, an ever vigilant outpost. To the north lay
      the fordable streams near Caswell City, and that way was perfect safety,
      it seemed. Not perfect, perhaps, for Barry knew nothing of the telephones
      by which the little bald headed clerk at the sheriff's office was rousing
      the countryside, but if he struck toward Caswell City from the Morgans,
      there was not a chance in ten that scouts would catch him at the river
      which was fordable for mile after mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      That way, then, lay the easiest escape, but it meant a long detour out of
      the shortest course, which struck almost exactly west, skirting
      dangerously close to Rickett. But, as Billy had presupposed, it was the
      very danger which lured the fugitive. Behind him, entangled in the gullies
      of the bad-lands, were the fifteen best men of the mountain-desert. In
      front of him lay nothing except the mind of Billy the clerk. But how could
      he know that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again he swayed a little forward and this time the stallion swung at
      once into his ranging gallop, then verged into a half-racing gait, for
      Barry wished to get out of sight among the rolling ground before the posse
      came out from the Morgan Hills on his back trail.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXI. The Trap
    </h2>
    <p>
      He had already covered a good ten miles, and a large part of that through
      extremely rough going, but the black ran with his head as high as the
      moment he pulled out of Rickett that morning, and there was only enough
      sweat to make his slender neck and greyhound flanks flash in the sun. Back
      he winged toward Rickett, running as freely as the wild leader of a herd,
      sometimes turning his fine head to one side to look back at the master or
      gaze over the hills, sometimes slackening to a trot up a sharper ascent or
      lengthening into a fuller gallop on an easy down-slope. There seemed no
      purpose in the reins which were kept just taut enough to give the rider
      the feel of his mount, and the left hand which held them was never still
      for a moment, but played back and forth slightly with the motion of the
      head. Except in times of crisis those reins were not for the transmission
      of orders, it seemed, but they served as the wires through which the mind
      of the man and the mind of the horse kept in telegraphic touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Black Bart loafed behind, lingering on the crest of each
      rise to look back, and then racing to catch up, but halfway back to
      Rickett he came up beside the master, whining, and leaping as high as
      Barry's knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seen something?&rdquo; queried Barry. &ldquo;Are they comin' on the trail again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swayed a bit to one side and diverted Satan out of his course so as to
      climb one of the more commanding swells. From this point he glanced back
      and saw a dust cloud, much like that which a small whirlwind picks up,
      rolling down the nearest slope of the Morgan Hills. At that distance the
      posse looked hardly larger than one unit, and certainly they could not see
      the single horseman they followed; however, they could follow the trail
      easily across this ground. Satan had turned to look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go back and play around 'em, boy?&rdquo; asked Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Bart had run on ahead, and now he turned with a short howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The partner says 'no,'&rdquo; continued the master. &ldquo;Of all the dogs I ever
      see, Bart plays the most careful game, but out on the trail, Satan&rdquo;&mdash;here
      he sent the stallion into the sweeping lope&mdash;&ldquo;Bart knows more'n you
      an' me put together, so we'll do what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer, Satan lengthened a little into his stride. As for the
      wolf-dog, he went off like a black bolt into the eye of the wind,
      streaking it west to hunt out the easiest course. A wolf&mdash;and surely
      there was more of wolf than of dog in Black Bart&mdash;has a finer sense
      for the lay of ground than anything on four feet. He knows how to come
      down the wind on his quarry keeping to the depressions and ravines so that
      not a taint of his presence is blown to the prey; and he will skulk across
      an open plain, stealing from hollow to hollow and stalking from bush to
      bush, so that the wariest are taken by surprise. As for Black Bart, he
      knew the kind of going which the stallion liked as well, almost, as he
      knew his own preferences, and he picked out a course which a surveyor with
      line and spirit-level could hardly have bettered. He wove across the
      country in loosely thrown semicircles, and came back in view of the master
      at the proper point. There was hardly much point in such industry in a
      country as smooth as this, not much more difference, say, than the saving
      of distance which the horse makes who hugs the fence on the turn and on
      account of that sticks his head under the finish wire a nose in front; and
      Bart clung to his work with scrupulous care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he ran back with lolling, red tongue, when the course lay clear
      even to the duller sense of a human, and frisked under the nose of Satan
      until a word from Barry sent him scurrying away like a pleased child. His
      duties comprehended not only the selection of the course but also an eagle
      vigilance before and behind, so that when he came again with a peculiar
      whine, Barry leaned a little from the saddle and spoke to him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'you mean to say that they been gainin' ground on us old boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Bart leaped sidewise, keeping his head toward the master, and he
      howled in troubled fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereaway are they now?&rdquo; muttered Barry, and looked back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great distance behind, hardly distinguishable now, the dust of the posse
      was blending into the landscape and losing itself against a gray
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they's nothin' wrong behind, what's bitin' you, Bart. You gettin'
      hungry, maybe? Want to hurry home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another howl, still louder, answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, then, and show me where they's trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black Bart whirled and darted off almost straight ahead, but bearing up a
      hill slightly south of their course. Toward the top of this eminence he
      changed his lope for a skulking trot that brought his belly fur trailing
      on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They's somethin' ahead of us, Satan!&rdquo; cried the master softly. &ldquo;What
      could that be? It's men, by the way Bart sneaks up to look at 'em. They's
      nothin' else that he'd do that way for. Easy, boy, and go soft!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stallion cut his gallop into a slinking trot, his head lowered, even
      his ears flat back, and glided up the hillside. Barry swung to the ground
      and crawled to the top of the hill. What he saw was a dozen mounted men
      swinging down into the low, broad scoop of ground beyond the hill. They
      raced with their hatbrims standing stiff up in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've been watchin' us with glasses!&rdquo; whispered Dan to Bart, and the
      wolf-dog snarled savagely, his neck-fur ruffling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dozen directly in front were not all, for to the right, bearing
      straight across his original course, came another group almost as strong,
      and to the left eight more riders spurred at top speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We almost walked into 'em,&rdquo; said Barry, &ldquo;but they ain't got us yet. Back,
      boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wolf dog slunk down the hill until it was out of sight from the
      farther side of the slope, and the master imitated these tactics until he
      was close to Satan. Once in the saddle he made up his mind quickly.
      Someone in Rickett had guessed his intention to double back toward Tucker
      Creek, and they had cut him off cleverly enough and in overwhelming force.
      However, no one in Rickett could guess that another way out remained for
      him in the fords below Caswell City, and even if they knew, their
      knowledge would do them no good. They could not wing a message to that
      place to head him off; it was not humanly possible. For Dan knew nothing
      of the telephone lines which brought Caswell City itself within speaking
      distance of far away Rickett. Caswell City, then, was his goal, but to get
      toward it he must circle far back toward the Morgan Hills, back almost
      into the teeth of the posse in order to skirt around the right wing of
      these new enemies. Even then, to double that flank, he must send Satan
      ahead at full speed. As he swung around, the eight men of that end party
      crashed over the hill five hundred yards away, and their yell at the view
      of the quarry went echoing up the shallow valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slayer of Pete Glass, he who had done the notorious Killing at Alder,
      was almost in touch of their revolvers&mdash;and their horses were fresh.
      Not one of that eight but would have given odds on his chances of sharing
      the capture money. There were no spurs on the heels of Barry to urge
      Satan, and no quirt in his hand, but a single word sent the black
      streaking down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going into the Morgan Hills he had gone like the wind, but now he rushed
      like a thoroughbred standing a challenge in the homestretch. His nose, and
      his flying tail were a straight line and the flash of his legs was a
      tangle which no eye could follow as he shot east on the back trail,
      straight toward the posse. For a mile or more that speed did not slacken,
      and at the end of that distance he began to edge to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men behind him knew well enough what the plan of the fugitive was, and
      they angled farther toward the north; there in the distance came the
      posse, the cloud of dust breaking up now into the dark figures of the
      fifteen, and if the men from St. Vincent could hold the pace a little
      longer they would drive Barry between two fires. They flattened themselves
      along their horses' necks at infinite risk to their necks in case of a
      stumble, and every spur in the crowd was dripping red; horseflesh could do
      no more, and still the black drew ahead inches and inches with every
      stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they could not turn him with their speed another way remained, and by
      swift agreement the four best horses were sent ahead at full speed while
      the other riders caught their reins over the pommels and jerked out their
      rifles; a quartet of bullets went screaming after the black horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, there was little enough chance that a placed shot would go home,
      but their magazines were full, and a chance hit would do the work and kill
      both man and horse at that rate of speed. Dan Barry knew it, and when the
      bullets sang he whirled in the saddle and swept out his rifle from its
      case in the same movement. That yellow devil of anger flared in his eyes
      as he pitched the butt to his shoulder and straight into the circle of the
      sight rode Johnny Gasney of St. Vincent. Another volley whistled about him
      and his finger trembled on the trigger. No chance work with Barry, for he
      knew the gait of Satan as a practized naval gunner knows the swing of his
      ship in a smooth sea, and that circle of doom wavered over Johnny Gasney
      for a dozen strides before Dan turned with a faint moan and jammed the
      rifle back in its case. Once again he was balancing in his stirrups,
      leaning close to cut the wind with his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do it, Satan. I got nothin' agin them. They think they're playin'
      square. I can't do it. Stretch out, old boy. Stretch out!&rdquo; It seemed
      impossible that the stallion could increase his exertions, but with that
      low voice at his ear he did literally stretch along the ground and jerked
      himself away from the pursuit like a tall ship when a new sail spreads in
      a gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men from St. Vincent saw that the game was lost. Every one of the
      eight had his rifle at the shoulder and the bullets hissed everywhere
      about him. Right into his face, but a greater distance away, rode the
      posse from Rickett, the fifteen tried men and true; and having caught the
      scheme of the trap they were killing their horses with a last effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It failed through no fault of theirs. Just as the jaws of the trap were
      about to close the black stallion whisked out from danger, lunged over a
      swell of ground, and was out of view. When they reached that point,
      yelling, Barry raced his black out of range of all except the wildest
      chance shot. The eight from St. Vincent drove their weapons sullenly into
      the holsters; for the last five minutes they had been silently dividing
      ten thousand dollars by eight, and the awakening left a taste of ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could only follow him now at a moderate pace in the hope of wearing
      him down, and since a slight pause made little difference in the result&mdash;it
      would even be an advantage to breathe their horses after that burst,&mdash;they
      drew rein and cursed in chorus.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXII. Relays
    </h2>
    <p>
      The horses from St. Vincent already wheezed from the run, but the mounts
      of the posse were staggering completely blown. Ever since they left
      Rickett they had been going at close to top speed and the last rush
      finished them; at least seven of that chosen fifteen would never be worth
      their salt again, and they stood with hanging heads, bloody foam upon
      their breasts and dripping from their mouths, their sides laboring, and
      breathing with that rattle which the rider dreads. The posse, to a man,
      swung sullenly to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's boss, boys?&rdquo; called Johnny Gasney, puffing in his saddle as he rode
      up. &ldquo;By God, we'll get him yet! They's a devil in that black hoss! Who's
      boss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't exactly boss,&rdquo; answered Mark Retherton, whom not even fear of
      death could hurry in his ways of speech, &ldquo;but maybe I can talk for the
      boys. What you want, Johnny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gents'll be needin' new hosses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be needin' graves for the ones we got,&rdquo; growled Mark, and he stared
      gloomily at the dull eye of his pinto. &ldquo;The best cuttin' out hoss I ever
      throwed a leg over, and now&mdash;look at him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's your relay!&rdquo; cut in Johnny Gasney. &ldquo;Old Billy 'phoned down.&rdquo; Five
      men came leading three spare horses apiece. &ldquo;He phoned down and asked me
      to get fifteen hosses ready. He must of guessed where Barry would head.
      And here they are&mdash;the best ponies in St. Vincent&mdash;but for God's
      sake use 'em better'n you did that set!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other members of the posse set to work silently changing their saddles
      to the new relay, and Mark Retherton tossed his answer over his shoulder
      to Johnny Gasney while he drew his cinch brutally tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They's a pile of hoss-flesh in these parts, but they ain't more'n one
      Barry. You gents can say good-bye to your hosses unless we nail him before
      they're run down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Gasney rubbed his red, fat forehead, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;because it ain't possible the black hoss
      can outlast these. But&mdash;he sure seemed full of runnin! One thing
      more, Mark. You don't need to fear pressin' Barry, because he won't shoot.
      He had his gun out, but I guess he don't want to run up his score any
      higher'n it is. He put it back without firin' a shot. Go on, boys, and go
      like hell. Billy has lined up a new relay for you at Wago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made no pause to start in a group, but each sent home the spurs as
      soon as he was in the saddle. They had ridden for the blood of Pete Glass
      before, but now at least seven of them rode for the sake of the horses
      they had ruined, and to a cow-puncher a favorite mount is as dear as a
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      They expected to find the black out of sight, but it was a welcome
      surprise to see him not half a mile away wading across St. Vincent Creek;
      for Barry quite accurately guessed that there would be a pause in the
      pursuit after that hair-breadth escape, and at the creek he stopped to let
      Satan get his wind. He would not trust the stallion to drink, but gave him
      a bare mouthful from his hat and loosened the cinches for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that this was absolutely necessary, for Satan was neither blown nor
      leg-weary. He stood dripping with sweat, indeed, but poised lightly, his
      head high, his ears pricked, his nostrils distended to transparency as he
      drew in great breaths. Even that interval Barry used, for he set to work
      vigorously massaging the muscles of shoulders and hips and whipping off
      the sweat from neck and flank. It was several moments, and already Satan's
      breath came easily, when Black Bart shot down from his watch-post and
      warned them on with a snarl, but still, before he tightened the cinches
      again and climbed to the saddle Barry took the fine head of the stallion
      between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between you and me, Satan,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;our day's work is jest
      beginnin'. Are you feelin' fit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Satan nuzzled the shoulder of the master and snorted his answer; Black
      Bart had given the warning, and the stallion was eager to be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the creek at a place where the stones came almost to the
      surface, since nothing is more detrimental to the speed of a horse than a
      plunge in cold water, and with the hoofbeats of the posse growing up
      behind they cantered off again a little cast of north, straight for
      Caswell City.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little work for Black Bart in such country as this, for there
      was rarely a rise of ground over which a man on horseback could not look,
      and the surface was race-track fast. Once Satan knew the direction there
      was nothing for it but to sit the saddle and let him work, and he fell
      into his long-distance gait. It was a smart pace for any ordinary animal
      to follow through half a day's journey, and Barry knew with perfect
      certainty that there was not the slightest chance of even the fresh horses
      behind him wearing down Satan before night; but to his astonishment the
      trailers rode as if they had limitless horseflesh at their command.
      Perhaps they were unaware of the running that was still in Satan, so Barry
      sent the stallion on at a free gallop that shunted the sagebrush past him
      in a dizzy whirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mile of this, but when he looked back the posse were even closer. They
      were riding still with the spur! It was madness, but it was not his part
      to worry for them, and it was necessary that he maintain at least this
      interval, so he leaned a little forward to cut the wind more easily, and
      Satan leaped into a faster pace. He had several distinct advantages over
      the mounts of the posse. At their customary rolling lope they will travel
      all day with hardly a break, but they have neither the size nor the length
      of leg for sustained bursts of speed. Moreover, most of the cowponies who
      now raced on the trail of Satan carried riders who outweighed Barry by
      twenty pounds and in addition to this they were burdened by saddles made
      ponderously to stand the strain of roping cattle, whereas Barry's
      specially made saddle was hardly half that weight. Perhaps more than all
      this, the cowponies rode by compulsion, urged with sharp spurs, checked
      and guided by the jaw-breaking curb, whereas Satan frolicked along at his
      own will, or at least at the will of a master which was one with his. No
      heavy bit worried his mouth, no pointed steel tormented his flanks. He had
      only one handicap&mdash;the weight of his rider, and that weight was
      balanced and distributed with the care of a perfect horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all this in mind it was hardly wonderful that the stallion kept the
      posse easily in play. His breathing was a trifle harder, now, and perhaps
      there was not quite the same light spring in his gallop, but Barry,
      looking back, could tell by the tossing heads of the horses which followed
      that they were being quickly run down to the last gasp. Mile after mile
      there was not a pause in that murderous pace, and then, cutting the sky
      with a row of sharply pointed roofs, he saw a town straight ahead and
      groaned in understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather new country to Barry, but the posse must know it like a
      book. They were spending their horses freely because they hoped to arrange
      for a fresh series of mounts in Wago. However, it would take some time for
      them to arrange the details of the loan, and by that time he would be out
      of sight among the hills which stretched ahead. That would give him a
      sufficient start, and he would make the fords near Caswell City
      comfortably ahead. At Caswell City, indeed, they might get a still other
      relay, but just beyond the Asper River rose the Grizzly Peaks&mdash;his
      own country, and once among them he could laugh the posse to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He patted Satan on the shoulder and swept on at redoubled speed, skirting
      close to the town, while the posse plunged straight into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listening closely, he could hear their shouts as they entered the village,
      could mark the cessation of their hoof-beats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes, five minutes at least for the change of horses, and that time
      would put him safety among the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the impossible happened. There was no pause of minutes, hardly a pause
      of seconds, when the rush of hoofbeats began again and poured out from the
      town, fifteen desperate riders on fifteen fresh mounts. By some miracle
      Wago had been warned and the needed horses had been kept there saddled and
      ready for the relay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned an easy escape into a close chance, but still his faith in Satan
      was boundless to reach the fords in time, and the safety of the mountains
      beyond. Another word, and with a snort the great-hearted stallion swept up
      the slope, with Black Bart at his old work, skirting ahead and choosing
      the easiest way. That was another great handicap in favor of the fugitive,
      and every advantage counted with redoubled significance now, every foot of
      distance saved, every inch of climb avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new obstacle confronted him, for the low, rolling hills were everywhere
      checkered with squares and oblongs of plowed ground, freshly turned, and
      guarded by tall fences of barbed-wire. They could be jumped, but jumping
      was no easy matter for a tiring horse, and Barry saw, with a sigh of
      relief, a sharp gulch to the left which cut straight through that region
      of broken farms and headed north and east pointing like an arrow in the
      direction of the fords. He swung down into it without a thought and
      pressed on. The bottom was gravelly, here and there, from the effect of
      the waters which had once washed through the ravine and cut these sides so
      straight, but over the greater part of the bottom sand had drifted, and
      the going was hardly worse than the hilly stretches above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sides grew higher, now, with great rapidity. Already they were up to
      the shoulder of Satan, now up to his withers, and from behind the roar of
      the posse racing at full speed, filled the gulch with confusion of echoes.
      They must be racing their horses as if they were entering the homestretch,
      as if they were sure of the goal. It was strange.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIII. The Jump
    </h2>
    <p>
      He brought Satan back to a hand canter, and so he pulled around the next
      curve of the gulch and saw the trap squarely in front. He came to a full
      halt. For he saw a tall, strong barbed-wire fence stretching across the
      stream-bed, and beyond the fence were a litter of chicken-coops, iron
      bands from broken barrels, and a thousand other of those things which
      brand the typical western farm-yard; above the top of the bank to his left
      he caught a glimpse of the sharp roof of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked back, but it was far too late to turn, ride down the ravine to a
      place where the bank could be scaled, and cut across country once more.
      The posse came like a whirlwind, yelling, shooting as if they hoped to
      attract attention, and attention they certainly won, for now Dan saw a
      tall middle-aged fellow, his long beard blowing over one shoulder as he
      ran, come down into the farm-yard with a double-barreled shotgun in his
      hands. He was a type of those who do not know what it is to miss their
      target&mdash;probably because ammunition comes so high; and with a double
      load of buckshot it was literally death to come within his range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan knew that a great many chances may be taken against a revolver and
      even a rifle can be tricked, but it is suicide to flirt with a shotgun in
      the hands of one used to bring down doves as they sloped out of the air
      toward a water-hole. The farmer stood with his broad-brimmed straw hat
      pushed far back on his head looking up and down the ravine, a perfect
      target, and Barry's hand slipped automatically over his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fingers refused to close upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do it, Satan,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;We got to take our chances of
      gettin' by, that's all. He couldn't have no hand with Grey Molly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Narrow chances indeed, by this time, for the brief pause had brought the
      posse fairly upon his heels; the farmer saw the fugitive and brought his
      shotgun to the ready; and Black Bart in an agony of impatience raced round
      and round the master. A wild cheer rose from the posse and came echoing
      about him; they had sighted their quarry. From Rickett to Morgan Hills,
      from Morgan Hills to St. Vincent, from St. Vincent to Wago and far beyond;
      but this was the end of an historic run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'ye see?&rdquo; whispered Barry, leaning close to Satan's ears. &ldquo;Lad, d'ye see
      what you've got to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black stood with his head very high, quivering through his whole body
      while he eyed the fence. It was murderously high, and all things were
      against him, the long run, the rise of the ground going toward the fence,
      and the gravel from which he must take off for the jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do it,&rdquo; said the master. &ldquo;You got to do it! Go for it, boy. We
      win or lose together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swayed forward, and Satan leaped ahead at full speed, gathering
      impetus, scattering the gravel on either side. The farmer on the inside of
      the fence raised his shotgun leisurely to his shoulder and took a careful
      aim. He knew what it all meant. He had heard of the outlaw, Barry, with
      his black horse and his wolf-dog&mdash;everyone in the desert had, for
      that matter&mdash;and even had he been ignorant the shouting of the posse
      which now raced down the canyon in full view would have told him all that
      he needed to know. How many things went through his mind while he squinted
      down the gleaming barrel! He thought of the long labor on the farm and the
      mortgage which still ate the life of his produce every year; he thought of
      the narrow bowed shoulders of his wife; he thought of the meager faces of
      his children; and he thought first and last of ten thousand dollars
      reward! No wonder the hand which supported the barrels was steady as an
      iron prop. He was shooting for his life and the happiness of five souls!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would save his fire till he literally saw the white of the enemy's
      eyes: until the outlaw reached the fence. No horse on the mountain-desert
      could top that highest strand of wire as he very well knew; and in his
      youth, back in Kentucky, he had ridden hunters. That fence came exactly to
      the top of his head, and the top of his head was six feet and two inches
      from the ground. To make assurance doubly sure he dropped upon one knee
      and made that shotgun an unstirring part and portion of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobly, nobly the black came on, his ears pricking as he judged the great
      task and his head carried a little high and back as any good jumper knows
      his head must be carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practiced eye of the farmer watched the outlaw gather his horse under
      him. Well he knew the meaning of that shortening grip on the reins to give
      the horse the last little lift that might mean success or failure in the
      jump. Well he knew that rise in the stirrups, that leaning forward, and
      his heart rose in unison and went back to the blue grass of Kentucky
      glittering in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them went the wolf-dog, skimming low, reached the fence, and shot
      over it in a graceful, high-arched curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the shout of the rider: &ldquo;Up! Up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the stallion reared and leaped. He seemed to graze it coming up, so
      close was his take-off; he seemed to be pawing his way over with the
      forefeet; and then with both legs doubled close, hugging his body, he shot
      across and left the highest strand of the wire quivering and humming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer hurled his best shotgun a dozen yards away and threw up his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go it, lad! God bless ye; and good luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand of the rider lifted in mute acknowledgment, and as he shot past,
      the farmer caught a glimpse of a delicately handsome face that smiled down
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The left gate! The left gate!&rdquo; he shouted through his cupped hands, and
      as the fugitive rushed through the upper gate he turned to face the posse
      which was already pulling up at the fence and drawing their wirecutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Barry shot out onto the higher ground on the other side of the
      farmhouse he could see them severing the wires and the interruption of the
      chase would be only a matter of seconds. But seconds counted triply now,
      and the halt and the time they would spend getting up impetus all told in
      favor of the fugitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirty-five miles, or thereabouts, since they left Rickett that morning,
      and still the black ran smoothly, with a lilt to his gallop. Dan Barry
      lifted his head and his whistling soared and pulsed and filled the air. It
      made Bart come back to him; it made Satan toss his head and glance at the
      master from the corner of his bright eye, for this was an assurance that
      the battle was over and the rest not far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they drove, straight as a bird flies for Caswell City, and Black Bart,
      ranging ahead among the hills, was picking the way once more. If the
      stallion were tired, he gave no sign of it. The sweep of his stride
      brushed him past rocks and shrubs, and he literally flowed uphill and
      down, far different from the horses which scampered in his rear, for they
      pounded the earth with their efforts, grunting under the weight of fifty
      pound saddles and heavy riders. Another handicap checked them, for while
      Satan ran on alone, freely, the bunched pursuers kept a continual friction
      back and forth. The leaders reined in to keep back with the mass of the
      posse, and those in the rear by dint of hard spurring would rush up to the
      front in turn until some spirited nag challenged for the lead, so that
      there was a steady interplay among the fifteen. Their gait at the best
      could not be more than the pace, of their slowest member, but even that
      pace was diminished by the difficulties of group riding. Yet Mark
      Retherton refused to allow his men to scatter and stretch out. He kept
      them in hand steadily, a bunched unit ready to strike together, for he had
      seen the dead body of Pete Glass and he kept in mind a picture of what
      might happen if this fellow should whirl and pick off the posse man by
      man. Better prolong the run, for in the end no single horse could stand up
      against so many relays. Yet it was maddening to watch the stallion float
      over hill and dale with that same unbroken stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once and again he sent the fresh horses from Wago after the fugitive in a
      sprinting burst, but each time the black drifted farther away, and mile
      after mile Mark Retherton pulled his field glasses to his eyes and
      strained his vision to make out some sign of labor in the gait of Satan.
      There was no change. His head was still high, the rhythm of his lope
      unfaltering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here the Wago Mountains&mdash;not more than ragged hills, to be sure&mdash;cut
      across the path of the outlaw and in those hills, unless the message which
      waited for him at Wago had been false, should be the men of Caswell City,
      two score or more besides the fifteen fresh horses for the posse. Two
      score of men, at least, Caswell could send out, and from the heights they
      could surely detect the coming of Barry and plant themselves in his way.
      An ambush, a volley, would end this famous ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hills came up on them swiftly, now, and if the men of Caswell failed
      in their duty it meant safety for the fugitive, because two miles beyond
      were the willows of the marshes and the fords across the Asper River.
      There could only be two alternatives, since not a man showed on the hills.
      Either they waited in ambush, or else they had mistaken the route along
      which Barry would come, and the latter was hardly possible. With his
      glasses Mark Retherton scanned the hills anxiously and it was then that he
      saw the dark form of the wolf-dog skulking on before the outlaw. He had
      watched Black Bart before this, of course, but never with suspicion until
      he noted the peculiar manner in which the animal skirted here and there
      through the rough ground, pausing on high places, weaving back and forth
      across the course of his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a scout,&rdquo; thought Retherton. &ldquo;And by God, there he comes to report!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Black Bart had whirled and raced straight back for Dan. There was no
      need of howl or whine to give the reason of his coming; the speed of his
      running meant business, and Barry shortened the pace of Satan while he
      looked over the hills, incredulous, despairing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be that men lurked there to cut him off. No living thing
      could have raced from Rickett to Caswell City to warn them of his coming.
      Nevertheless, there came Bart with the ill tidings, and it only remained
      to skirt swiftly east, round the dangerous ground, and strike the marshes
      first. He swung Satan around on the new course with a pressure of his
      knees and loosed him into a freer gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must have sensed the meaning of this maneuver at once, for hardly had
      he stretched out east when voices shouted out of the hills, and around and
      over several low knolls came forty horsemen, racing. Half a dozen were
      already due east&mdash;no escape that way; and the long line of the others
      came straight at him with the slope of the ground to give them velocity.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIV. The Warning
    </h2>
    <p>
      All in a grim instant he saw the trap. It closed upon his consciousness
      with a click, and as he doubled Satan around he knew that the only escape
      was in running southeast along the banks of the Asper. Even that was a
      desperate, a forlorn chance, for if that omnipotent voice could reach from
      Rickett to Caswell City, fifty miles away, certainly it must have warned
      the river towns of Ganton and Wilsonville and Bly Falls where Tucker Creek
      ran into the Asper. But this was no time for thinking. Already, looking
      back, he saw the posse changing their saddles to fifteen fresh mounts, and
      he headed Satan across the Wago Hills, West and South.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hot work. Even the steel-wire muscles of Black Bart were weakening
      under the tremendous labors of that day, and as he scouted ahead his head
      was low and his red tongue lolled, and surest sign of all, the bushy tail
      drooped; yet it was time to make a new call upon both wolf-dog and horse,
      for the posse was racing after him as before, giving even the fresh,
      willing mounts the urge of spurs and quirts. He ran his hand down the
      dripping neck and shoulder of Satan; he called to him; and with a snort
      the stallion responded. He felt the quiver as the muscles tightened for
      the work; he felt the settling as Satan lengthened to racing speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the Wago Hills, then, with Bart picking the way as before, and
      never a falter in the sweep of Satan's running. If his head was a little
      lower, if his ears lay flat, only the master knew the meaning, and still,
      when he spoke, the glistening ears pricked up, and they bounded on to a
      greater speed than before. The flight of a gull on unstirring wings when
      the wind buoys it, the glide of water over the descent of smooth rock,
      with never a ripple, like all things effortless, swift, and free, such was
      the gait of Satan as he fled. Let them spur the fresh horses from Caswell
      City till their flanks dripped red, they would never gain on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On through the hills, and now the heave of his great breaths told of the
      strain, down like an arrow into the rolling ground, and now they galloped
      beside the Asper banks. The master looked darkly upon that water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days before, when the snows had not yet reached the climax of melting,
      ten days later when that climax was overpassed, the Asper would have been
      fordable, but now a brown flood stormed along the gully, ate away the
      banks, undermined the willows here and there, and rolled stones larger
      than a man could lift. It went with an angry shouting as if it defied the
      fugitive. It was narrow, maddeningly narrow, almost small enough to
      attempt a leap across to the safety of the thickets on the farther side,
      but the force of the water alone was enough to warn the bravest swimmer
      away, and here and there, like teeth in the mouth of the shark, jagged
      stones cut the surface with white foam streaking out below them; as if to
      prove its power, even while Dan turned South along the bank a dead trunk
      shot down the stream and split on one of the Asper's teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then he felt the temptation. There lay the forest on the farther
      side, a forest which would shelter him, and above the forest, hardly a
      mile back, began the Grizzly Peaks. They lunged straight up to snowy
      summits, and all along their sides blue shadows of the afternoon drifted
      through a network of ravines&mdash;a promise of peace, a surety of safety
      if he could reach that labyrinth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost glad when he left the mockery of the river's noise to turn
      aside for Ganton. There it lay in a bend of the Asper in the low-lands,
      and every town where men lived was an enemy. He could see them now
      gathered just outside the village, twenty men, perhaps and fifteen spare
      horses, the best they had, for the posse.
    </p>
    <p>
      On past Ganton, and again a call upon Satan to meet the first spurt of the
      posse on its new horses. There was something in the stallion to answer,
      some incredible reserve of nerve strength and courage. There was a slight
      labor, now, and something of the same heave and pitch which comes in the
      gait of a common horse; also, when he put Satan up the first slope beyond
      Ganton he noted a faltering, a deeper lowering of the head. When his hoofs
      struck a loose rock he no longer had the easy recoil of the morning. He
      staggered like a graceful yacht chopped by a cross-current. Now down the
      slope, now back to the roar of the Asper once more, for there the going
      was most level, but always the strides were shortening, shortening, and
      the head of the stallion nodded at his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that was seen by Mark Retherton through his glasses, though they were
      almost close enough now to see details through the naked eye. He turned in
      the saddle to the posse, grim faces, sweat and dust clotted in their
      moustaches, their faces drawn and gray with streaks over the nose and
      under the eyes where perspiration ran. They rode crookedly, now, for
      seventy miles at full speed had racked them, twisted them, cramped their
      muscles. Scotty kept his head tilted far back, for his spinal column
      seemed about to snap. Walsh leaned to his right side which a tormenting
      pain drew at every stride, and Hendricks cursed in gasps through a wry
      mouth. It had been an hour since Mark Retherton last spoke, and when he
      attempted it now his voice was as hoarse as a croaking frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, buck up! He's done! D'ye see the black laborin'. D'ye see it? Hey,
      Lew, Garry, we've got the best hosses among us three. Now's the time for a
      spurt, and by God, we'll run him down. I'm startin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made his word good with an Indian yell and a wave of his hat that sent
      his buckskin leaping straight into the air, to land with stiff legs,
      &ldquo;swallowing its head,&rdquo; but then it straightened out in earnest. That
      buckskin had a name from Bly Falls to Caswell City between speed and courage, and
      it lived up to the record in the time of need. Close behind it came Lew
      and Garry ponies scarcely slower than the buckskin, and they closed
      rapidly on Satan. The plan of Retherton was plain: now that the black was
      running on its nerve a spurt might bring them within striking distance and
      if they could check the flight for an instant by opening advance guard
      fire, they might drive the fugitive into a corner by the river and hold
      him there until the main body the posse came up. The three of them running
      alone the lead could do five yards for every four of the slow horses, and
      the effect showed at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going up a slope the trot of the stallion maintained or even increased his
      lead, but when they reached the easier ground beyond they drew rapidly
      upon him. They saw Barry bend low; they saw the stallion increase its
      pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God,&rdquo; shouted Retherton in involuntary admonition, &ldquo;I'd rather have
      that hoss than the ten thousand. But feed 'em the spurs, boys, and he'll
      come back to us inside a mile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Retherton was right. Before that mile was over the black slipped back
      inch by inch, until at length Retherton called: &ldquo;Now grab your guns boys
      and see if you can salt him down with lead. Give your hosses their heads
      and turn loose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They pulled their guns to their shoulders and sent a volley at the outlaw.
      One bullet clipped a spark from the rocks just behind the stallion's feet;
      the other two must have gone wide. Once more Barry flinched closer over
      the neck of Satan and once again the horse answered with a fresh burst of
      speed, but in a few moments he came back to them. Flesh could not stand
      that pace after seventy-five miles of running.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw the rider straighten and look back; then the sun flashed on his
      rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feed 'em the spur!&rdquo; shouted Retherton. &ldquo;If we can't hit him shooting
      ahead, he ain't got a chance to hit us shootin' backwards.&rdquo; For it is
      notoriously hard to turn in the saddle and accomplish anything with a
      rifle. One is moving away from the target instead of toward it, and every
      condition of ordinary shooting is reversed; above all, the moment a man
      turns his head he is completely out of touch with his horse. Apparently
      the fugitive knew this and made no attempt to place his shots. He merely
      jerked his gun to the shoulder and blazed away as soon as it was in place;
      half a dozen yards in front of Retherton the bullet kicked up the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;He can't do nothin' that way. Close in, boys.
      Close in for God's sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He himself was flailing with his quirt, and the buckskin grunted at every
      strike. Once more the rifle pitched to the outlaw's shoulder, and this
      time the bullet clicked on a rock not ten feet from Retherton, and again
      on a straight line for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damned if that ain't shootin'!&rdquo; called Garry, and Retherton, alarmed,
      swung the buckskin out to one side to throw the marksman out of line. He
      had turned again in the saddle, and as though the episode were at an end,
      restored his rifle to its case, but when they poured in another volley
      about him, he swung sharply roundabout again, gun in hand. Once more the
      rifle went to his shoulder, and this time the bullet knocked a puff of
      dust into the very nostrils of the buckskin. Retherton reined in with an
      oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's been warn in' me, boys,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;That devil has the range like
      he was sitting in a rockin' chair shooting at a tin-can. He's warnin' us
      back to the rest of the gang. And damned if we ain't goin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite patent that he was right, for three bullets sent on a line
      for one horse, and each of them closer, could mean only one thing. They
      checked their horses, and in a moment the rest of the posse was clattering
      around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't make no difference,&rdquo; called Retherton, &ldquo;savin' in time. Maybe
      he'll last to Wilsonville, but he can't stay in three miles when we hang
      onto him with fresh hosses. The black is runnin' on nothin' but guts right
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXV. The Asper
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ninety miles of ground, at least, had been covered by the black stallion,
      since he left Rickett that morning, yet when he galloped across the plain
      in full sight of Wilsonville there were plenty of witnesses who vowed that
      Satan ran like a colt frolicking over a pasture. Mark Retherton knew
      better, and the posse to a man felt the end was near. They changed saddles
      in a savage silence and went down the street out of town with a roar of
      racing hoofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Barry too, as he watched them whip around the corner of the last house
      and streak across the fields, knew that the end of the ride was near.
      Strength, wind and nerve were gone from Satan; his hoofs pounded the
      ground with the stamp of a plowhorse; his breath came in wheezes with a
      rattle toward the end; the tail no longer fluttered out straight behind.
      Yet when the master leaned and called he found something in his great
      heart with which to answer. A ghost of his old buoyancy came in his
      stride, the drooping head rose, one ear quivered up, and he ran against
      the challenge of those fresh ponies from Wilsonville. There were men who
      doubted it when the tale was told, but Mark Retherton swore to the truth
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then that desperate effort was failing. Not all the generous will in
      the heart of the stallion could give his legs the speed they needed; and
      he fell back by inches, by feet, by yards, toward the posse. They
      disdained their guns now, and kept them in the cases; for the game was
      theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then they noted an odd activity in the fugitive, who had slipped to
      one side and was fumbling at his cinches. They could not understand for a
      time, but presently the saddle came loose, the cinches flipped out, and
      the whole apparatus crashed to the ground. Nor was this all. The rider
      leaned forward and his hands worked on the head of his mount until the
      hackamore also came free and was tossed aside. To that thing fifteen good
      men and true swore the next day with strange oaths, and told how a man
      rode for his life on a horse that wore neither saddle nor bridle but ran
      obediently to voice and hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every ounce counted, and there were other ounces to be spared. He was
      leaning again, to this side and then to that, and presently the posse
      rushed past the discarded riding-boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lay the rifle in its case on the saddle far behind. And with the
      rifle remained all the fugitive's chances of fighting at long range. Now,
      following, came the heavy cartridge belt and the revolver with it. The
      very sombrero was torn from his head and thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      His horse was failing visibly; not even this lightening could keep it away
      from the posse long; and yet the man threw away his sole chance of safety.
      And the fifteen pursuers cursed solemnly as they saw the truth. He would
      run his horse to death and then die with it empty handed rather than let
      either of them fall a captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unburdened by saddle or gun or trapping, the stallion gave himself in the
      last effort. There ahead lay safety, if they could shake off this last
      relay of the posse, and for a time he pulled away until Retherton grew
      anxious, and once more the bullets went questing around the fugitive. But
      it was a dying effort. They gained; they drew away; and then they were
      only holding the posse even, and then once more, they fell back gradually
      toward the pursuit. It was the end, and Barry sat bolt erect and looked
      around him; that would be the last of him and the last scene he should
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came the posse, distant but running closer. With every stride Satan
      staggered; with every stride his head drooped, and all the lilt of his
      running was gone. Ten minutes, five minutes more and the fifteen would be
      around him. He looked to the river which thundered there at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the very swiftest portion of all the Asper between Tucker Creek and
      Caswell City. Even at that moment, a few hundred yards away, a tall tree
      which had been undermined, fell into the stream and dashed the spray high;
      yet even that fall was silent in the general roar of the river. Checked by
      the body and the branches of the tree for an instant before it should be
      torn away from the bank and shot down stream, the waters boiled and left a
      comparatively smooth, swift sliding current beyond the obstruction; and it
      gave to Barry a chance or a ghost of a chance:
    </p>
    <p>
      The central portion of the river bed was chopped with sharp rocks which
      tore the stream into white rages of foam; but beyond these rocks, a little
      past the middle, the tree like a dam smoothed out the current; it was
      still swift but not torn with swirls or cross-currents, and in that
      triangle of comparatively still water of which the base was the fallen
      tree, the apex lay on a sand bar, jutting a few yards from the bank. And
      the forlorn hope of Barry was to swing the stallion a little distance away
      from the banks, run him with the last of his ebbing strength straight for
      the bank, and try to clear the rocky portion of the river bed with a long
      leap that might, by the grace of God, shoot him into the comparatively
      protected current. Even then it would be a game only a tithe won, for the
      chances were ten to one that before they could struggle close to the
      shore, the currents would suck them out toward the center. They would
      never reach that shelving bit of sand, but the sharp rocks of the stream
      would tear them a moment later like teeth. Yet the dimmest chance was a
      good chance now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called Satan away from his course, and at the change of direction the
      stallion staggered, but went on, turned at another call, and headed
      straight for the stream. He was blind with running; he was numbed by the
      long horror of that effort, no doubt, but there was enough strength left
      in him to understand the master's mind. He tossed his head high, he
      flaunted out his tail, and sped with a ghost of his old sweeping gallop
      toward the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart!&rdquo; shouted the master, and waved his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the wolf saw too. He seemed to cringe for a moment, and then, like
      some old leader of a pack who knows he is about to die and defies his
      death, he darted for the river and flung himself through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant later Satan reared on the bank and shot into the air. Below him
      the teeth of the rocks seemed to lift up in hunger, and the white foam
      jumped to take him. The crest of the arc of his jump was passed; he shot
      lower and grazing the last of the stones he plunged out of sight in the
      swift water beyond. There were two falls, not one, for even while the
      black was in the air Barry slipped from his back and struck the water
      clear of Satan.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came up again struggling in the last effort toward the shore. The
      impetus of their leap had washed them well in toward the bank, but the
      currents dragged them out again toward the center of the stream where the
      rocks waited. Down river they went, and Black Bart alone had a ghost of a
      chance for success. His leap had been farther and he skimmed the surface
      when he struck so that by dint of fierce swimming he hugged close to the
      shore, and then his claws bedded in the sand-bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Barry, the waters caught him and sent him spinning over and over,
      like a log, whipping down stream, while the heavier body of Satan was
      struggling whole yards above. There was no chance for the master to reach
      the sand-bank, and even if he reached it he could not cling; but the
      wolf-dog knew many things about water. In the times of famine long years
      before the days of the master there had been ways of catching fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He edged forward until the water foamed about his shoulders. Down came
      Dan, his arms tumbling as he whirled, and on the sleeve of one of those
      arms the teeth of Bart closed. The cloth was stout, and yet it ripped as
      if it were rotten veiling, and the tug nearly swept Bart from his place.
      Still, he clung; his teeth shifted their hold with the speed of light and
      closed over the arm of the master itself, slipped, sank deeper, drew
      blood, and held. Barry swung around and a moment later stood with his feet
      buried firmly in the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not a moment to spare, for Satan, only his eyes and his nose
      showing, rushed down the current, making his last fight. Barry thrust his
      feet deeper in the sand, leaned, buried both hands in the mane of the
      stallion. It was a far fiercer tug-of-war this time, for the ample body of
      the horse gave the water a greater surface to grapple on, yet the strength
      of the man sufficed. His back bowed; his shoulders ached with the strain;
      and then the forefeet of Satan pawed the sand, and all three staggered up
      the shelving bank, reeled among the trees, and collapsed in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      So great was the roar of the water that they heard neither shouts nor the
      reports of the guns, but for several minutes the bullets of the posse
      combed the shrubbery as high as the breast of a man.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVI. The Empty Cave
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through ten months of the year a child of ten could wade the Asper but now
      its deep roaring that set the ground quivering under Barry gave him
      perfect assurance of safety. Not one of that posse would attempt the
      crossing, he felt, but he slipped back through the shrubbery close to the
      bank to make sure. He was in time to see Mark Retherton give a command
      with gestures that sent reluctant guns into the holsters. Fists were
      brandished toward the green covert on the farther side of the river, so
      close, such an unreachable distance. One or two rode their horses down to
      the very edge of the water, but they gave up the thought and the whole
      troop turned back toward Wilsonville; even the horses were down-headed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the covert he found Bart lying with his head on his paws, his eyes
      closed, his sides swelling and closing till every rib seemed broken; yet
      now and then he opened one red eye to look at Satan. The stallion lay in
      almost exactly the same position, and the rush and rattle of his breathing
      was audible even in the noise of the Asper; Barry dropped prone and
      pressed his ear against the left side of the horse, just behind the
      shoulder. The fierce vibration fairly shook his head; he could hear the
      rush of the blood except when that deadly rattling of the breath came.
      When he rose to his knees the face of the master was serious, thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satan!&rdquo; he called, but the river must have drowned his voice. Only when
      he passed his fingers down the wet neck, one of Satan's ears pricked, and
      fell instantly back. It would not do to let him lie there in the cool mold
      by the water, for he knew that the greatest danger in overheating a horse
      is that it may cool too quickly afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped directly in front of Satan and swept up an arm in command; it
      brought only a flicker of the eyelid, the eyelid which drooped over a
      glazing eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up!&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      One ear again pricked; the head lifted barely clear of the ground; the
      forelegs stiffened with effort, trembled, and were still again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart!&rdquo; shouted the master, &ldquo;wake him up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice could not have carried to the wolf through the uproar of the
      waters, but the gesture, the expression brought home the order, and Black
      Bart came to his feet, staggering. Right against the nose of Satan he
      bared his great teeth and his snarl rattled. No living creature could hear
      that sound without starting, and the head of Satan raised high. Still
      before him Bart growled and under his elbow and his chest the hands of the
      master strained up. He swayed with a snort very like a human groan,
      struggled, the forelegs secured their purchase, and he came slowly to his
      feet. There he stood, braced and head low; a child might have caught him
      by the mane and toppled him upon his side, and already his hind legs were
      buckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on!&rdquo; cried Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a lift of the head, a quivering of the tensed nostrils, but that
      was all. He seemed to be dying on his feet, when the master whistled. The
      sound cut through the rushing of the Asper as a ray of light probes a dark
      room, shrill, harsh, like the hissing of some incredible snake, and Satan
      went an uncertain step forward, reeled, almost fell; but the shoulder of
      the master was at his side lifting up, and the arm of the master was under
      his chest, raising. He tried another step; he went on among the trees with
      his forelegs sprawling and his head drooped as though he were trying to
      crop grass. Black Bart did his part to recall that flagging spirit.
      Sometimes it was his snarl that startled the black; sometimes he leaped,
      and his teeth clashed a hair's breadth from Satan's nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees the congealing blood flowed freely again through Satan's body;
      he no longer staggered; and now he lifted a forepaw and struck vaguely at
      Bart as the wolf-dog leaped. Barry stepped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart!&rdquo; he called, and the shouting of the Asper was now so far away that
      he could be heard. &ldquo;Come round here, old boy, and stop botherin' him. He's
      goin' to pull through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned against a willow, his face suddenly old and white with something
      more than exhaustion, and laughed in such an oddly pitched, cracked tone
      that the wolf-dog slunk to him on his belly and licked the dangling hand.
      He caught the scarred head of Bart and looked steadily down into the eyes
      of the wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a close call, Bart. There wasn't more than half an inch between
      Satan and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black turned his head and whinnied feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to him callin' for help like a new-foaled colt,&rdquo; said the master,
      and went to Satan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head of the stallion rested on his shoulder as they went slowly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;you get two pieces of pone without askin'.&rdquo;
       The cold nose of the jealous wolf-dog thrust against his left hind. &ldquo;You
      too, Bart. You showed us the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rattle had left the breathing of Satan, the stagger was gone from his
      walk; with each instant he grew perceptibly larger as they approached the
      border of the wood. It fell off to a scattering thicket with the Grizzly
      Peaks stepping swiftly up to the sky. This was their magic instant in all
      the day, when the sun, grown low in the west, with bulging sides, gave the
      mountains a yellow light. They swelled up larger with warm tints of gold
      rolling off into the blue of the canyons; at the foot of the nearest slope
      a thicket of quaking aspens was struck by a breeze and flashed all silver.
      Not many moments more, and all the peaks would be falling back into the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that Satan saw this, for he raised his head from the shoulder of
      the master and stopped to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step on,&rdquo; commanded Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stallion shook himself violently as a dog that knocks the water from
      his pelt, but he took no pace forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The order made him sway forward, but he checked the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you man to man, Bart,&rdquo; said the master in sudden anger, &ldquo;was there
      ever a worse fool hoss than him? He won't budge till I get on his back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wolf-dog shoved his nose again into Barry's hand and growled. He
      seemed quite willing to go on alone with the master and leave Satan
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;Satan, are you comin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse whinnied, but would not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his back and walked resolutely across the meadow, but slowly,
      and more slowly, until a ringing neigh made him stop and turn. Satan had
      not stirred from his first halting place, but now his head was high and
      his ears pricked anxiously. He pawed the ground in his impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there, Bart,&rdquo; observed the master gloomily. &ldquo;There's pride for you.
      He won't let on that he's too weak to carry me. Now I'd ought to let him
      stay there till he drops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whistled suddenly, the call sliding up, breaking, and rising again with
      a sharp appeal. Satan neighed again as it died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that won't bring him, nothin' will. Back we got to go. Bart, you jest
      take this to heart: It ain't any use tryin' to bring them to reason that
      ain't got any sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back and sprang lightly to the back of the horse and Satan
      staggered a little under the weight but once, as if to prove that his
      strength was more than equal to the task, he broke into a trot. A harsh
      order called him back to a walk, and so they started up into the Grizzly
      Peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dark, however, a few halts, a chance to crop grass for a moment here
      and there, a roll by the next creek and a short draught of water, restored
      a great part of the black's strength, and before the night was an hour old
      he was heading up through the hills at a long, swift trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then it was that dark, cold time just before dawn when they wound up
      the difficult pass toward the cave. The moon had gone down; a thin, high
      mist painted out the stars; and there were only varying degrees of
      blackness to show them the way, with peaks and ridges starting here and
      there out of the night, very suddenly. It was so dark, indeed, that
      sometimes Dan could not see where Bart skulked a little ahead, weaving
      among the boulders and picking the easiest way. But all three of them knew
      the course by instinct, and when they came to a more or less commanding
      rise of ground in the valley Dan checked the stallion and whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat canting his head to one side to listen more intently. A rising
      wind brought about him something like an echo of the sound, but otherwise
      there was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain't heard,&rdquo; muttered Dan to Bart, who came running back at the
      call, so familiar to him and to the horse. He whistled again, prolonging
      the call until it soared and trembled down the gulch, and this time when
      he stopped he sat for a long moment, waiting, until Black Bart whined at
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain't learned to sleep light, yet,&rdquo; muttered Barry. &ldquo;An' I s'pose
      she's plumb tired out waitin' for me. But if something's happened&mdash;Satan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That word sent the stallion leaping ahead at a racing gait, swerving among
      rocks which he could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They's nothin' wrong with her,&rdquo; whispered Barry to himself. &ldquo;They can't
      be nothin' happened to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in the cave, a moment later, standing in the center of the place
      with the torch high above his head; it flared and glimmered in the great
      eyes of Satan and the narrow eyes of Bart. At length he slipped down to a
      rock beside him while the torch, fallen from his hand, sputtered and
      whispered where it lay on the gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's gone,&rdquo; he said to emptiness. &ldquo;She's lef' me&mdash;&rdquo; Black Bart
      licked his limp hand but dared not even whine.

      Chapter XXXVII. Ben Swann
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since the night when old Joe Cumberland died and Kate Cumberland rode off
      after her wild man, Ben Swann, the foreman of the Cumberland ranch, had
      lived in the big house. He would have been vastly more comfortable in the
      bunkhouse playing cards with the other hands, but Ben Swann felt vaguely
      that it was a shame for so much space in the ranch house to go to waste,
      and besides, Ben's natural dignity was at home in the place even if his
      mind grew lonely. It was Ben Swann, therefore, who ran down and flung open
      the door, on which a heavy hand was beating. Outside stood two men, very
      tall, taller than himself, and one of them a giant. They had about them a
      strong scent of horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a light&rdquo; said one of these. &ldquo;Run for it. Get a light. Start a fire,
      and be damned quick about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who the hell might you gents be?&rdquo; queried Ben Swann, leaning against
      the side of the doorway to dicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw that fool on his head,&rdquo; said one of the strangers, &ldquo;and go on in,
      Lee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand aside,&rdquo; said the other, and swept the doorknob out of Ben's grip,
      flattening Ben himself against the wall. While he struggled there,
      gasping, a man and a woman slipped past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him who we are,&rdquo; said the woman's voice. &ldquo;We'll go to the
      living-room, Buck, and start a fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strangers apparently knew their way even in the dark, for presently he
      heard the scraping of wood on the hearth in the living-room. It bewildered
      Ben Swann. It was dream-like, this sudden invasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, who the devil are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A match was scratched and held under his very nose, until Ben shrank back
      for fear that his splendid mustaches might ignite. He found himself
      confronted by one of the largest men he had ever seen, a leonine face,
      vaguely familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You Lee Haines!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;What are you doin' here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're Swann, the foreman, aren't you?&rdquo; said Haines. &ldquo;Well, come out of
      your dream, man. The owner of the ranch is in the living-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe Cumberland's dead,&rdquo; stammered Ben Swann.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate Cumberland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her! And&mdash;Barry&mdash;the Killing at Alder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; ordered Haines, and his face grew ugly. &ldquo;Don't let that chatter
      get to Kate's ears. Barry ain't with her. Only his kid. Now stir about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the first surprise was over, Ben Swann did very well. He found the
      fire already started in the living-room and on the rug before the hearth a
      yellow-haired little girl wrapped in a tawny hide. She was sound asleep,
      worn out by the long ride, and she seemed to Ben Swann a very pretty
      picture. Surely there could be in her little of the father of whom he had
      heard so much&mdash;of whom that story of the Killing at Alder was lately
      told. He took in that picture at a glance and then went to rustle food;
      afterward he went down to sleep in the bunkhouse and at breakfast he
      recounted the events of the night with a relish. Not one of the men had
      been more than three years on the place, and therefore their minds were
      clean slates on which Swann could write his own impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Appearances is deceivin'&rdquo; concluded the foreman. &ldquo;Look at Mrs. Dan Barry.
      They tell you around these parts that she's pretty, but they don't tell
      you how damned fine lookin' she is. She's got a soft look and you'd never
      pick her for the sort that would run clean off with a gent like Barry.
      Barry himself wasn't so bad for looks, but they'll tell you in Elkhead how
      bad he is in action, and maybe they's some widders in Alder that could put
      in a word. Take even the kid. She looks no more'n a baby, but what d'you
      know is inside of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speakin' personal, gents, I don't put no kind of trust in that houseful
      yonder. Here they come in the middle of the night like there was a posse
      after 'em. They climb that house and sit down and eat like they'd ridden
      all day. Maybe they had. Even while they was eatin' they didn't seem none
      too happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That loose shutter upstairs come around in the wind with a bang and Buck
      Daniels comes out of his chair as fast as powder could blow him. He didn't
      say nothin'. Just sat down lookin' kind of sick, and the other two was the
      same way. When they talked, they'd bust off in the middle of a word and
      let their eyes go trailin' into some corner of the room that was plumb
      full of shadow. Then Lee Haines gets up and walks up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Swann,' says he, 'how many good men have you got on the place?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why,' says I, 'they're all good!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Huh,' says Haines, and he puts a hand on my shoulder, 'Just how good are
      they, Swann?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seen what he wanted. He wanted to know how many scrappy gents was
      punchin' cows here; maybe them three up there figures that they might need
      help. From what? What was they runnin' away from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; broke in one of the cowpunchers, pointing with a dramatic fork
      through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright spot of gold that disappeared over the top of the nearest
      hill; then it came into view again, the whole body of a yellow-haired
      child, clothed in a wisp of white, and running steadily toward the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kid!&rdquo; gasped the foreman. &ldquo;Boys, grab her. No, you'd bust her; I know
      how to handle her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone through the door with gigantic leaps and shot over the crest
      of the low hill. Then those in the cookhouse heard a small, tingling
      scream; after it, came silence, and the tall foreman striding across the
      hill with the child high in his arms. He came panting through the door and
      stood her up on the end of the table, a small and fearless creature. She
      wore on her feet the little moccasins which Dan himself had fashioned for
      her, but the tawny hide was not on her&mdash;perhaps her mother had thrown
      the garment away. The moccasins and the white nightgown were the sum and
      substance of her apparel, and the cowpunchers stood up around the table to
      admire her spunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damed near spat pizen,&rdquo; observed Ben Swann, &ldquo;when I hung into her&mdash;tried
      to bite me, but the minute I got her in my hands she quit strugglin', as
      reasonable as a grown-up, by God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Ben. Don't you know no better'n to cuss in front of a kid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great, dark eyes of Joan went somberly from face to face. If she was
      afraid, she disguised it well, but now and then, like a wild thing which
      sees that escape is impossible, she looked through the window and out over
      the open country beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was you headed for, honey?&rdquo; queried Ben Swann.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child considered him bravely for a time before she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there? Now what might she mean by that? Headed for Elkhead&mdash;in
      a nightgown? Any place I could take you, kid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she did not altogether trust Ben Swann, at least she preferred him to
      the other unshaven, work-thinned faces which leered at her around the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Dan,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Joan wants to go to Daddy Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Dan&mdash;Dan Barry,&rdquo; translated Ben Swann, and he drew a bit away
      from her. &ldquo;Boys, that mankillin' devil must be around here; and that's
      what them up to the house was runnin' from&mdash;Barry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It scattered the others to the windows, to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swann, if Barry is comin' to these parts, I'm goin' to pack my war-bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me too, Ben. Them that get ten thousand'll earn it. I heard about the
      Killin' at Alder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, gents,&rdquo; observed Ben Swann. &ldquo;If Barry is comin' here we
      ain't none of us goin' to stay; but don't start jumpin' out from under
      till I get the straight of it. I'm goin' to take the kid up to the house
      right now and find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he wrapped up Joan in an old blanket, for she was shivering in the cold
      of the early morning, and carried her up to the ranchhouse. The alarm had
      already been given. He saw Buck Daniels gallop toward the front of the
      place leading two saddled horses; he saw Haines and Kate run down the
      steps to meet them, and then they caught sight of the foreman coming with
      Joan on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joy of that meeting, it seemed to Ben Swann, was decidedly one-sided.
      Kate ran to Joan with a little wailing cry of happiness and gathered her
      close, but neither big Lee Haines nor ugly Buck Daniels seemed overcome
      with happiness at the regaining of Joan, and the child herself merely
      endured the caresses of her mother. Ben Swann made them a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told them that anybody with half an eye could tell they were bothered
      by something, that they acted as if they were running away. Now, running
      in itself was perfectly all right and quite in order when it was
      impossible to outface or outbluff a danger. He himself, Ben Swann,
      believed in such tactics. He wasn't a soldier; he was a cowpuncher. So
      were the rest of the boys out yonder, and though they'd stay by their work
      in ordinary times, and they'd face ordinary trouble, they were not minded
      to abide the coming of Dan Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; concluded Swann, &ldquo;I want to ask you straight. Is him they call
      Whistlin' Dan comin' this way? Are you runnin' from him? And did you steal
      the kid from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lee Haines took upon his competent shoulders the duty of answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like a sensible man, Swann,&rdquo; he said severely. &ldquo;I'm surprised at
      you. In the first place, two men don't run away from one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fleeting smile appeared and disappeared on the lips of Ben Swann. Haines
      hastily went on: &ldquo;As for stealing the baby from Dan Barry, good heavens,
      man, don't you think a mother has a right to her own child? Now go back to
      that scared bunch and tell them that Dan Barry is back in the Grizzly
      Peaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For several reasons this did not completely satisfy the foreman, but he
      postponed his decision. Lee Haines spoke like one in the habit of giving
      orders, and Swann walked slowly back to the cookhouse.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVIII. The New Alliance
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Lee Haines, when he joined Buck Daniels in the living-room,
      &ldquo;there goes our reinforcements. That whole crew will scatter like dead
      leaves when Barry breezes in. It looks to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; cut in Daniels. &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His dark, homely face turned to the larger man with a singular expression
      of awe. He whispered: &ldquo;D'you hear? She's in the next room whippin' Joan
      for runnin' away, and never a yap out of the kid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up a lean finger for caution and then Haines heard the sound of
      the willow switch. It stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you run away again,&rdquo; warned Kate, her voice pitched high and
      trembling, &ldquo;munner will whip harder, and put you in a dark place for a
      long, long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still there was not a sound of the child's voice, not even the pulse of
      stifled weeping. Presently the door opened and Kate stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out in the kitchen and tell Li to give you breakfast. Naughty girls
      can't eat with munner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the door came Joan, her little round face perfectly white,
      perfectly expressionless. She did not cringe, passing her mother; she
      walked steadily across the room, rose on tip-toe to open the kitchen door,
      and disappeared through it. Kate dropped into a chair, shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out!&rdquo; whispered Buck to Lee Haines. &ldquo;Beat it. I got to talk alone.&rdquo; And
      as soon as Haines obeyed, Buck sat down close to the girl. She was
      twisting and untangling her fingers in a dumb agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done to her, Buck? What has he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a maxim with Buck that talk is to woman what swearing is to man; it
      is a safety valve, and therefore he waited in silence until the first rush
      of her grief had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She only looked at me when I whipped her. My heart turned in me. She
      didn't cry; she wasn't even angry. She just stood there&mdash;my baby!&mdash;and
      looked at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself back in the chair with her eyes closed, and he saw where
      the trouble had marked her face. He wanted to lean over and take her in
      his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going mad, Buck. I can't stand it. How could he have changed her to
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Kate. Joan ain't been changed. She's only showin' what she
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother stared wildly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look like I was a murderer. God knows I'm sorry, Kate, but if
      they's Dan's blood in your little girl it ain't my fault. It ain't
      anything he's taught her. It's just that bein' alone with him has brought
      out what she really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't believe you, Buck. I don't dare listen to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got to listen, Kate, because you know I'm right. D'you think that any
      kind of teachin' could make her learn how to stand and keep from cryin'
      when she was whipped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke softly, as if some terrible power might overhear them talk, and
      Buck lowered his voice in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's wild, Kate, I knew it when I seen the way she handled Bart. She's
      wild!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll have her tame again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tried that once and failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan was a man when I tried, and his nature was formed. Joan is only a
      baby&mdash;my baby. She's half mine. She has my hair and my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what the color of her eyes is, I know what's behind them.
      Look at 'em, and then tell me who she takes after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buck, why do you talk like this? What do you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hard thing. Send Joan back to Dan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll never give her up, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God help me. What shall I do? I'll keep her! I'll make her tame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll never keep her that way. Think of Dan. Think of the yaller in
      his eyes, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until I die,&rdquo; she said with sudden quiet, &ldquo;I'll fight to keep her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he answered with equal solemnity: &ldquo;Until Dan dies he'll fight to have
      her. And he's never been beat yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through a breathing space he stared at her and she at him, and the eyes of
      Buck Daniels were the first to turn. Everything that was womanly and
      gentle had died from her face, and in its stead was something which made
      Buck rise and wander from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Lee Haines and told him briefly all that had passed. The great
      battle, they decided, had begun between Kate and Barry for the sake of the
      child, and that battle would go on until one of them was dead or the prize
      for which they struggled lost. Barry would come on the trail and find them
      at the ranch, and then he would strike for Joan. And they had no help for
      the struggle against him. The cowpunchers would scatter at the first sign
      of Barry, at the first shrill of his ill-omened whistling. They might ride
      for Elkhead and raise a posse from among the citizens, but it would take
      two days to do that and gather a number of effective fighters for the
      crisis, and in the meantime the chances were large that Barry would strike
      the ranch while the messenger was away. There was really nothing to do but
      sit patiently and wait. They were both brave men, very; and they were both
      not unpracticed fighters; but they began to wait for the coming of Barry
      as the prisoner waits for the day of his execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It spoke well for the quality of their nerves that they would not speak to
      Kate of the time to come; they sat back like spectators at a play and
      watched the maneuvers of the mother to win back Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not an idle moment from breakfast to dark. They went out to
      gather wildflowers on the western hill from the house; they sat on the
      veranda where Kate told Joan stories of the ranch and pointed out the
      distant mountains which were its boundaries, and explained that all
      between them would one day be her own land; that the men who rode yonder
      were doing her work; that the cattle who ranged the hills were marked with
      her brand. She said it all in small words so that Joan could understand,
      but as far as Buck and Lee could make out, there was never a flicker of
      intelligence or interest in the eyes of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hard battle every hour, and after supper Kate sat in a big chair
      by the fire with her eyes half closed, admitting defeat, perhaps. For Joan
      was curled up on the couch at the farthest, dimmest end of the room, and
      with her chin propped in both small hands she stared in silence through
      the window and over the darkening hills. Buck and Lee were there, never
      speaking, but now and then their eyes sought each other with a vague hope.
      For Kate might see that her task was impossible, send Joan back, and that
      would free them of the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where Kate left off, chance took up the battle and turned the scales.
      Old Li, the Chinese cook, had not seen Kate for six long years, and now he
      celebrated the return by hanging about her on a thousand pretexts. It was
      just after he had brought in some delicacy from the kitchen, leaving the
      door a little ajar, when a small ball of gray fur nosed its way through
      the aperture and came straight for the glare of the fire on the hearth. It
      was a small shepherd puppy, and having observed the faces of the men with
      bright, unafraid eyes, it went wobbling on to the very hearth, sniffling.
      Even at that age it knew enough to keep away from the bright coals of
      wood, but how could it know that the dark, cold-looking andirons had been
      heated to the danger point by the fire? It thrust out a tentative nose,
      touched the iron, and then its shrill yelp of pain went startlingly
      through the room. It pulled the three grown-ups out of their thoughts; it
      brought Joan scampering across the room with a little happy cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The puppy would have escaped if it could, for it had in mind the dark,
      warm, familiar corner in Li's kitchen where no harm ever came near, but
      the agile hands of Joan caught him; he was swept into her arms. That
      little wail of helpless pain, the soft fluff of fur against her cheek,
      wiped all other things from Joan's mind. Out the window and across the
      gloomy hills she had been staring at the picture of the cave, and
      bright-eyed Satan, and the shadowy form of Bart, and the swift, gentle
      hand of Daddy Dan; but the cry of the puppy blotted the picture out. She
      was no longer lonely, having this small, soft body to protect. There sat
      her mother, leaning a little toward her with a glance at once misted and
      bright, and she forgot forthwith all the agency of Kate in carrying her
      away from that cave of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, munner! He's burned his nose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The puppy was licking the injured nose industriously and whimpering the
      while. And Joan heard no answer from her mother except an inarticulate
      little sound somewhere deep in Kate's throat. Over her child mind,
      vaguely, like all baby memories, moved a recollection of the same sound,
      coming deeply from the throat of the mother and marvelously soothing,
      reassuring. It moved a fiber of trust and sympathy in Joan, an emotion as
      real as the sound of music, and with the puppy held idly in her arms for a
      moment, she looked curiously into Kate's face. On her own, a faint smile
      began in the eyes and spread to the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little puppy, munner,&rdquo; said Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands of Kate trembled with desire to bring Joan closer to her, but
      very wisely she merely stroked the cringing head of the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little puppy,&rdquo; she echoed.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIX. Victory
    </h2>
    <p>
      The entrance of the puppy, to liken small things to great, was the coming
      of Blucher in Kate's life, for the battle turned, and all in five minutes
      she had gone from defeat to victory. She sat by the fire with Joan
      sleeping in her arms, and the puppy in turn in the arms of Joan. It was
      such a foolish trick of chance that had given her all this, she was almost
      inclined to laugh, but something of tragedy in the faces of Buck and Lee
      Haines made her thoroughly serious. And she readily saw the truth for
      after all a child's brain is a small affair; it holds so much and no more.
      One instant the longing for Dan was all that Joan could think of; the next
      she had no room for anything more than the burned nose of the puppy&mdash;if
      there were other phases to this matter&mdash;such as Buck Daniels had
      pointed out&mdash;fear that in some future crisis the blood of the father
      might show in the child, Kate pushed such thoughts away. She was too full
      of the present happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, while she sat there in the firelight, she sang softly into the dreams
      of Joan, and watched the smile of sleep grow and wane faintly on the lips
      of the child as the rhythm of her singing lifted and fell. One half of her
      mind was empty, that part where Dan should have been, and a dozen times
      she checked an impulse to turn to him in the place where he should be
      sitting and invite him with a smile to share her happiness. When her eyes
      moved they only fell on the gaunt, intent face of Buck or the leonine head
      of Haines. Whistling Dan was gone and if he ever came again her fear of
      him, her fear for Joan, would be greater than her love. Yet Dan being gone
      so finally, she knew that she would never be truly happy again. Her spring
      of life was ended, but even now she was grateful for the full richness of
      those six years with Dan; and if she turned from him now it was only
      because a mighty instinct commanded her and a voice without words drove
      her&mdash;Joan must go on to a normal, womanly happiness. Dan Barry lived
      from day to day, glutting himself with a ride in the wind, or the whistle
      of a far-off bird, or the wail of a mountain-lion through the night. Each
      instant was to him complete, but the eye of Kate looked far away and saw
      the night when this daughter of hers should sit holding an infant by such
      a fire, and her heart was both empty and full.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no wonder, then, that she heard the first sound long before either
      Haines or Buck Daniels, for her mind was on guard against dangers which
      might threaten her baby. It was a faint slipping, scratching noise on the
      veranda; then a breathing at the front door. Kate turned, and the men
      followed the terror of her eyes in time to see the door fall open, and a
      broad paw appear in the interval. The snaky head of Black Bart thrust into
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word, Daniels drew his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; commanded Kate. Joan awoke with a start at the sharpness of this
      voice. &ldquo;Don't shoot, Buck. See that bit of paper under his throat. He's
      bringing a message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart!&rdquo; cried Joan, slipping to the floor from her mother's lap, but when
      she ran toward the wolf-dog, that tremendous snarl of warning stopped her
      short. Bart slunk toward Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Kate!&rdquo; cried Haines. &ldquo;The black devil means murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't move, or he'll go at your throat,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;There's no danger
      to me. He's been ordered to go to me and he won't let even Joan touch him.
      See!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had glided past the amazed, outstretched arms of Joan and went straight
      to Kate and stopped beside her, obviously expectant. She reached for the
      slip of folded paper, and as her hand approached he crouched a little,
      growling; but it was only to caution her, apparently, and though he
      distrusted the hand, he allowed it to unfasten the missive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She untwisted the note, she read aloud: &ldquo;Kate, send Joan back to me or I
      come for her. Send her with Bart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as though the wolf-dog understood the written words, for now he
      moved toward Joan and she, with a cry, dropped the squealing puppy and
      caught the great head of Bart in her arms. The puppy wailed, sitting down
      on his haunches, and quivering with grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Dan wants me,&rdquo; explained Joan with bright eyes. &ldquo;He's sent for me.
      Go quick, Bart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big animal lay down to facilitate her mounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; called Kate. The child hesitated and turned toward her. Her mother
      had taken up that light revolver which Dan had taught her to use so well,
      and now, as she leveled it at the wolf-dog, Bart laid his fangs bare in
      silent hate. The weapons of Buck and Lee Haines were ready, and now Bart
      raised himself a little and commenced to drag gradually forward to leaping
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop your gun, Kate,&rdquo; cautioned Buck. &ldquo;For God's sake drop your gun. Even
      if you hit him with a bullet, he'll be at your throat. Unless you kill him
      with the first shot he'll have you. Drop your gun, and then he'll go at
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Joan knew perfectly well what those gleaming bits of steel meant. She
      had seen Daddy Dan shoot and kill, and now she ran screaming between Bart
      and danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You bad, bad men. I won't let you hurt Bart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won't hurt you, Bart,&rdquo; explained Joan, taming much mollified to the
      great wolf-dog. &ldquo;They're just playin'. Now we'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she started toward the door, with Bart slinking in front and keeping a
      watchful lookout from a corner of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to leave the poor little puppy, Joan?&rdquo; said the mother,
      keeping her voice steady, for all the force of the two men could not help
      her now. It rested with her wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take him with me,&rdquo; answered Joan, and caught up the howling puppy
      from the floor. His wails died out against her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you mustn't do that, honey. He'd die in this cold night wind long
      before you got there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; sighed Joan, and considered her mother with great eyes. Black Bart
      turned and uneasily tugged at her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take good care of him, munner? Till I come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't know how to take care of him, dear. If you go he'll cry and
      cry and cry until he dies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joan sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how quiet he is when you hold him, Joan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; muttered Joan again. The distress of the problem made her wrinkle
      her forehead. She turned to Kate for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munner, what'll I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd best stay here until the puppy is strong enough to go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept her voice well under control; it would not do to show the
      slightest emotion, and now she sat down and half turned away from the
      child. With her eyes she flashed a signal at the two troubled men and they
      followed her lead. Their center of vision was now upon the fire. It left
      Joan, to all appearances, quite out of notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that'll be a long, long time, munner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little while, Joan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Daddy Dan'll be lonesome up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has Satan and Bart to keep him company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think he wants Joan, munner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as much as the poor little puppy wants you, Joan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She added, with just the slightest tremor: &ldquo;You decide for yourself, Joan.
      Go if you think it is best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart, what'll Joan do?&rdquo; queried the child, turning in dismay toward the
      wolf-dog, but as soon as he saw the puppy in her arms, he greeted her with
      a murderous snarl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; suggested her mother, &ldquo;that Black Bart would eat up the poor
      little puppy if you went now with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this alarming thought, Joan shrank away from Bart and when he followed
      her, anxiously, she cried: &ldquo;Go away! Bad dog! Bad Bart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught the edge of her dress and drew back toward the door, and this
      threw Joan into a sudden panic. She struck Bart across his wrinkled
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; he slunk back, snarling at the puppy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to Daddy Dan.&rdquo; Then, as he pricked his ears, still growling like
      distant thunder: &ldquo;Go tell Daddy Dan that Joan has to stay here a while.
      Munner, how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe a week, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A whole week?&rdquo; she cried, dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps only one or two or three days,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of her tenseness was leaving as she saw victory once more inclining
      to her standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One, two, five days,&rdquo; counted Joan, &ldquo;and then come for me again. Tell
      Daddy Dan that, Bart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes left her and wandered around the room, lingering for a vicious
      instant on the face of each, then he backed toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's clear of Joan now, Kate,&rdquo; whispered Buck. &ldquo;Let me shoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Don't even look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a scratching of sudden claws, Bart whirled at the door and was
      gone like a bolt down the hall. Afterwards for a time there was no sound
      in the room except the murmurings of Joan to her puppy, and then they
      heard that most mournful of sounds on the mountain-desert, the long howl
      of a wolf which has missed its kill, and hunts hungry on a new trail.

    <h2>
      Chapter XL. The Failure
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Black Bart returned without Joan, without even a note of answer about
      his neck, the master made ready to take by force. First he went over his
      new outfit of saddle and guns, looking to every strap of the former, and
      the latter, revolvers and rifle, he weighed and balanced with a meditative
      look, as if he were memorizing their qualities against a time of need.
      With Satan saddled and Bart on guard at the mouth of the cave, he gathered
      up all the accumulation of odds and ends, provisions, skins, and made a
      stirring bonfire in the middle of the gravel floor. It was like burning
      his bridges before starting out to the battle; he turned his back to the
      cave and started on his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to travel in a loose semicircle, for there were two points which he
      must reach on the ride, the town of Alder, where lived the seventh man who
      must die for Grey Molly, and the Cumberland ranch, last of all, where he
      would take Joan. Very early after his start he reached the plateau where
      he had lived all those years with Kate, and he found it already sinking
      back to ruin, with nothing in the corrals, and the front door swinging to
      and fro idly in the wind, just as Joan had often played with it. Inside,
      he knew, the rooms were empty; a current of air down the chimney had
      scattered the ashes from the hearth all about the living room. Here must
      be a chair overturned, and there the sand had drifted through the open
      door. All this he saw clearly enough with his mind's eye, and urged Satan
      forward. For a chill like the falling of sudden night had swept over him,
      and he shrugged his shoulders with relief when he swept past the house.
      Yet when he came to the long down-slope which pitched into the valley so
      far below him, he called Satan to a halt again, and swung to look at the
      house. He could hear the clatter of the front door as it swung; it seemed
      to be waving a farewell to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all the work of a moment, to ride back, gather a quantity of paper
      and readily inflammable materials, soak them in oil, and scratch a match.
      The flames swept up the sides of the logs and caught on the ceiling first
      of all, and Dan Barry stood in the center of the room until the terrified
      whining of Black Bart and the teeth of the wolf-dog at his trousers made
      him turn and leave the house. Outside, he found Satan trembling between
      two temptations, the first to run as far and as fast as he could from that
      most terrible thing&mdash;fire; and the second to gallop straight into the
      blaze. The voice of the master, a touch quieted him, and Black Bart lay
      down at the feet of the master and looked up into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the fire had licked away a passage through the roof and
      through this it sent up a yellow hand that flicked up and down like a
      signal, or a beckoning, and then shot up a tall, steady, growing, roaring
      column of red. No man could say what went through the mind of Dan Barry as
      he stood there watching the house of his building burn, but now he turned
      and threw his arms over the neck and back of Satan, and dropped his
      forehead against the withers of the black. It troubled the stallion. He
      turned his head, and nosed the shoulder of the master gently, and Black
      Bart, in an agony of anxiety, reared up beside Dan and brought his head
      almost up to the head of the man; there he whined pleadingly for never
      before had he seen the master hide his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep, short report made the master stand away from Satan. The fire had
      reached a small stock of powder, and the shock of the explosion was
      followed by a great crashing and rending as an inner wall went down. That
      fall washed a solid mass of yellow flame across the front door, but the
      fire fell back, and then Dan saw the doll which he himself had made for
      Joan; it had been thrown by the smashing of the wall squarely in front of
      the door, and now the fire reached after it&mdash;long arms across the
      floor. It was an odd contrivance, singularly made of carved wood and with
      arms and legs fastened on by means of bits of strong sinew, and Joan
      prized it above all the rosy faced dolls which Kate had bought for her.
      For an instant Dan stood watching the progress of the fire, then he leaped
      through the door, swerved back as an arm of fire shot out at him, ran
      forward again, caught up the doll and was outside rubbing away the singed
      portions of brows and lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not wait until the house was consumed, but when the flames stood
      towering above the roof, shaking out to one side with a roar when the wind
      struck them, he mounted Satan once more, and made for the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to reach Alder at dark, and he gauged the time of his ride so
      accurately that when he pulled out of the mouth of Murphy's Pass, the last
      light of the day was still on the mountains and in the pass, but it was
      already dark in the village, and a score of lights twinkled up at him like
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Satan and Bart well outside the town, for even in the dark they
      might easily be recognized, and then walked straight down the street of
      Alder. It was a bold thing to do, but he knew that the first thing which
      is seen and suspected is the skulker who approaches from covert to covert.
      They knew he had ridden into Alder before in the middle of the night and
      they might suspect the danger of such another attack, but they surely
      would not have fear of a solitary pedestrian unless a telltale light were
      thrown upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed Captain Lorrimer's saloon. Even in this short interval it had
      fallen into ill-repute after the killing at Alder. And a shanty farther
      down the street now did the liquor business of the town; Captain
      Lorrimer's was closed, and the window nailed across with slats. He went
      on. Partly by instinct, and partly because it was aflame with lights, he
      moved straight to the house at which he had learned tidings of three men
      he sought on his last visit to Alder. Now there were more lights showing
      from the windows of that place than there were in all the rest of Alder;
      at the hitching racks in front, horses stood tethered in long double rows,
      and a noise of voices rolled out and up and down the street. Undoubtedly,
      there was a festival there, and all Alder would turn out to such an
      affair. All Alder, including Vic Gregg, the seventh man. A group came down
      the street for the widow's house; they were laughing and shouting, and
      they carried lanterns; away from them Barry slipped like a ghost and stood
      in the shadow of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There might be other such crowds, and they were dangerous to Barry, so now
      he hunted for a means of breaking into the house of the widow unseen. The
      windows, as he went down the side of the building, he noted to be high,
      but not too high to be reached by a skillful, noiseless climber. In the
      back of the house he saw the kitchen door, illumined indeed, but the room,
      as far as he could see, empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then very suddenly a wave of silence began somewhere in a side of the
      house and swept across it, dying to a murmur at the edges. Barry waited
      for no more maneuvers, but walked boldly up the back stairs and entered
      the house, hat in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he passed the door he was alert, balanced. He could have swung
      to either side, or whirled and shot behind him with the precision of a
      leisurely marksman, and as he walked he smiled, happily with his head held
      high. He seemed so young, then, that one would have said he had just come
      in gaily from some game with the other youths of Alder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the kitchen he passed into the hall, and there he understood the
      meaning of the silence, for both the doors to the front room were open,
      and through the doors he heard a single voice, deep and solemn, and
      through the doors he saw the crowd standing motionless. Their heads did
      not stir,&mdash;heads on which the hair was plastered smoothly down&mdash;and
      when some one raised a hand to touch an itching ear, or nose, he moved his
      arm with such caution that it seemed he feared to set a magazine of powder
      on fire. All their backs were towards Barry, where he stood in the hall,
      and as he glided toward them, he heard the deep voice stop, and then the
      trembling voice of a girl speak in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first entrance he paused, for the whole scene unrolled before him.
      It was a wedding. Just in front of him, on chairs and even on benches, sat
      the majority of adult Alder,&mdash;facing these stood the wedding pair
      with the minister just in front of them. He could see the girl to one side
      of the minister's back, and she was very pretty, very femininely
      appealing, now, in a dress which was a cloudy effect of white; but Barry
      gave her only one sharp glance. His attention was for the men of the
      crowd. And although there were only backs of heads, and side glimpses of
      faces he hunted swiftly for Vic Gregg.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gregg was not there. He surveyed the assembly twice, incredulous, for
      surely the tall man should be here, but when he was on the very point of
      turning on his heel and slinking down the hall to pursue his hunt in other
      quarters, the voice of the minister stopped, and the deep tone of Vic
      himself rolled through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It startled Barry like a voice out of the sky; he stared about,
      bewildered, and then as the minister shifted his position a little he saw
      that it was Gregg who stood there beside the girl in white,&mdash;it was
      Gregg being married. And at the same moment, the eyes of Vic lifted,
      wandered, fell upon the face which stood there framed in the dark of the
      doorway. Dan saw the flush die out, saw the narrow, single-purposed face
      of Gregg turn white, saw his eyes widen, and his own hand closed on his
      gun. Another instant; the minister turned his head, seemed to be waiting,
      and then Gregg spoke in answer: &ldquo;I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thousand pictures rushed through the mind of Barry, and he remembered
      first and last the wounded man on the gray horse who he had saved, and the
      long, hard ride carrying that limp body to the cabin in the mountains. The
      man would fight. By the motion of Gregg's hand, Dan knew that he had gone
      even to his wedding armed. He had only to show his own gun to bring on the
      crisis, and in the meantime the eyes of Vic held steadily upon him past
      the shoulder of the minister, without fear, desperately. In spite of
      himself Dan's hand could not move his gun. In spite of himself he looked
      to the confused happy face of the girl. And he felt as he had felt when he
      set fire to his house up there in the hills. The wavering lasted only a
      moment longer; then he turned and slipped noiselessly down the hall, and
      the seventh man who should have died for Grey Molly was still alive.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLI. The Wild Geese
    </h2>
    <p>
      Twenty-four hours from Alder to Elkhead, and beyond Elkhead to the
      Cumberland ranch, is long riding and hard riding, but not far after dark
      on the following night, Joan lifted her head, where she played with the
      puppy on the hearth, and listened. There was no sound audible to the
      others in the living room; they did not even mark the manner in which she
      sat up, and then rose to her feet. But when she whispered &ldquo;Daddy Dan!&rdquo; it
      brought each of the three out of his chair. Still they heard nothing, and
      Buck and Lee Haines would have retaken their chairs had not Kate gone to
      the window and thrown it wide. Then they caught it, very far off, very
      thin and small, a delicate thread of music, an eerie whistling. Without a
      word, she closed the window, crossed the room and from the table she took
      up a cartridge belt from which hung the holster with the revolver which
      Whistling Dan taught her to use so well. She buckled it about her. Lee
      Haines and Daniels, without a word, imitated her actions. Their guns were
      already on&mdash;every moment since they reached the ranch they had gone
      armed but now they looked to them, and tried the actions a few times
      before they thrust them back into the holsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was odd to watch them. They were like the last remnant of a garrison,
      outworn with fighting, which prepares in grim quiet for the final stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whistling rose a little in volume now. It was a happy sound, without a
      recognizable tune, but a gay, wild improvisation as if a violinist, drunk,
      was remembering snatches of masterpieces, throwing out lovely fragments
      here and there and filling the intervals out of his own excited fancy.
      Joan ran to the window, forgetful of the puppy, and kneeled there in the
      chair, looking out. The whistling stopped as Kate drew down the curtain to
      cut out Joan's view. It was far too dark for the child to see out, but she
      often would sit like this, looking into the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whistling began again as Joan turned silently on her mother,
      uncomplaining, but with a singular glint in her eyes, a sort of
      flickering, inward light that came out by glances and starts. Now the
      sound of the rider blew closer and closer. Kate gestured the men to their
      positions, one for each of the two inner doors while she herself took the
      outer one. There was not a trace of color in her face, but otherwise she
      was as calm as a stone, and from her an atmosphere pervaded the room, so
      that men also stood quietly at their posts, without a word, without a sign
      to each other. They had their unspoken order from Kate. She would resist
      to the death and she expected the same from them. They were prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still that crescendo of the whistling continued; it seemed as if it would
      never reach them; it grew loud as a bird singing in that very room, and
      still it continued to swell, increase&mdash;then suddenly went out. As if
      it were the signal for which she had been waiting all these heartbreaking
      moments, Kate opened the front door, ran quickly down the hall, and stood
      an instant later on the path in front of the house. She had locked the
      doors as she went through, and now she heard one of the men rattling the
      lock to follow her. The rattling ceased. Evidently they decided that they
      would hold the fort as they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heel hardly sank in the sand when she saw him. He came out of the
      night like a black shadow among shadows, with the speed of the wind to
      carry him. A light creak of leather as he halted, a glimmer of star light
      on Satan as he wheeled, a clink of steel, and then Dan was coming up the
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew him perfectly even before she could make out the details of the
      form; she knew him by the light, swift, almost noiseless step, like the
      padding footfall of a great cat&mdash;a sense of weight without sound.
      Another form skulked behind him&mdash;Black Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was close, very close, before he stopped, or seemed to see her, though
      she felt that he must have been aware of her since he first rode up. He
      was so close, indeed, that the starlight&mdash;the brim of his hat
      standing up somewhat from the swift riding&mdash;showed his face quite
      clearly to her. It was boyish, almost, in its extreme youth, and so thinly
      molded, and his frame so lightly made, that he seemed one risen from a
      wasting bed of sickness. The wind fluttered his shirt and she wondered, as
      she had wondered so often before, where he gained that incredible strength
      in so meager a body. In all her life she had never loved him as she loved
      him now. But her mind was as fixed as a star.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't have her, Dan. You can't have her! Don't you see how terrible a
      thing you'd make her? She's my blood, my pain, my love, and you want to
      take her up yonder to the mountains and the loneliness&mdash;I'll die to
      keep her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the moon, which had been buried in a drift of clouds, broke through
      them, and seemed in an instant to slide a vast distance towards the earth,
      a crooked half moon with its edges eaten by the mist. Under this light she
      could see him more clearly, and she became aware of the thing she dreaded,
      the faint smile which barely touched at the corners of his mouth; and in
      his eyes a swirl of yellow light, half guessed at, half real. All her
      strength poured out of her. She felt her knees buckle, felt the fingers
      about the light revolver butt relax, felt every nerve grow slack. She was
      helpless, and it was not fear of the man, but of something which stalked
      behind him, inhuman, irresistible; not the wolf-dog, but something more
      than Satan, and Bart, and Whistling Dan, something of which they were only
      a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to whistle, thoughtfully, like one who considers a plan of action
      and yet hesitates to begin. She felt his eyes run over her, as if judging
      how he should put her most gently to one side; then from the house, very
      lightly, hardly more than an echo of Dan's whistling, came an answer&mdash;the
      very same refrain. Joan was calling to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that he stepped forward, but the thing which stirred him, had hardened
      the mind of Kate. The weakness passed in a flash. It was Joan, and for
      Joan!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a step!&rdquo; she whispered, and jerked out her gun. &ldquo;Not a step!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood with one hand trailing carelessly from his hip, and at the gleam
      of her steel his other hand dropped to a holster, fumbled there, and came
      away empty; he could not touch her, not with the weight of a finger. That
      thoughtful whistle came again: once more the answering whistle drifted out
      from the house; and he moved forward another pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had chosen her mark carefully, the upper corner of the seam of the
      pocket upon his shirt, and before his foot struck the ground she fired.
      For an instant she felt that she missed the mark, for he stood perfectly
      upright, but when she saw that the yellow was gone from his eyes. They
      were empty of everything except a great wonder. He wavered to his knees,
      and then sank down with his arms around Black Bart. He seemed, indeed, to
      crumple away into the night. Then she heard a shouting and trampling in
      the house, and a breaking open of doors, and she knew that she had killed
      Whistling Dan. She would have gone to him, but the snarl of Bart drove her
      back. Then she saw Satan galloping up the path and come to a sliding halt
      where he stood with his delicate nose close to the face of the master.
      There was no struggle with death, only a sigh like a motion of wind in far
      off trees, and then, softly, easily Black Bart extricated himself from the
      master, and moved away down the path, all wolf, all wild. Behind him,
      Satan whirled with a snort, and they rushed away into the night each in an
      opposite direction. The long companionship of the three was ended, and the
      seventh man was dead for Grey Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lee Haines and Buck Daniels were around her now. She heard nothing
      distinctly, only a great, vague clamor of voices while she kneeled and
      turned the body of Barry on its back. It was marvelously light; she could
      almost have picked it up in her arms, she felt. She folded the hands
      across his breast, and the limp fingers were delicate as the fingers of a
      sick child. Buck Daniels lay prone by the dead man weeping aloud; and Lee
      Haines stood with his face buried in his hands; but there was no tear on
      the face of Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she closed the eyes, the empty, hollow eyes, she heard a distant
      calling, a hoarse and dissonant chiming. She looked up and saw a wedge of
      wild geese flying low across the moon.
    </p>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
