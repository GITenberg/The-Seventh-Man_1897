description: The Seventh Man by Max Brand, tells part of the story of the larger-than-life
  western character, Dan Barry, known as "Whistling Dan," and his alter-ego companions,
  Black Bart, the wolf-dog, and Satan, the indomitable black stallion. It's also the
  story of Kate Cumberland and the incredible five-year-old daughter of Kate and Dan,
  Joan. We first see Dan as a gentle, caring man with a deep sense of fairness. But
  then, after six years of a peaceful life in their mountain cabin Dan, more feral
  than human, sets out to revenge an injustice by killing seven men. Ultimately, it
  is his devot.
